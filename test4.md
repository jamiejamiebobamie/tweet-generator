Hungry, hungry hippos is the game I play. I play hungry hippos each and every day. You and hungry hippos is all I wanna do. And while I might be done with hungry hippos, I’ll never be done with you. Hungry, hungry hippos is the game I play. And though I play it each and every day, it never loses it’s sway. Help me. Jamie Jamie Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie.

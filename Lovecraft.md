I

I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice
without knowing why. It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for
opposing this contemplated invasion of the antarctic - with its vast fossil hunt
and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient ice caps. And I am the more
reluctant because my warning may be in vain.

Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet, if I suppressed
what will seem extravagant and incredible, there would be nothing left. The
hitherto withheld photographs, both ordinary and aerial, will count in my favor,
for they are damnably vivid and graphic. Still, they will be doubted because of
the great lengths to which clever fakery can be carried. The ink drawings, of
course, will be jeered at as obvious impostures, notwithstanding a strangeness of
technique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle over.

In the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few scientific leaders
who have, on the one hand, sufficient independence of thought to weigh my data
on its own hideously convincing merits or in the light of certain primordial and
highly baffling myth cycles; and on the other hand, sufficient influence to deter
the exploring world in general from any rash and over-ambitious program in the
region of those mountains of madness. It is an unfortunate fact that relatively
obscure men like myself and my associates, connected only with a small
university, have little chance of making an impression where matters of a wildly
bizarre or highly controversial nature are concerned.

It is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, specialists in the
fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a geologist, my object in leading
the Miskatonic University Expedition was wholly that of securing deep-level
specimens of rock and soil from various parts of the antarctic continent, aided by
the remarkable drill devised by Professor Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering
department. I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this, but I did
hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points along



previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto
unreached by the ordinary methods of collection.

Pabodie's drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our reports, was
unique and radical in its lightness, portability, and capacity to combine the
ordinary artesian drill principle with the principle of the small circular rock drill
in such a way as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness. Steel head,
jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick, dynamiting
paraphernalia, cording, rubbish- removal auger, and sectional piping for bores
five inches wide and up to one thousand feet deep all formed, with needed
accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog sledges could carry. This was
made possible by the clever aluminum alloy of which most of the metal objects
were fashioned. Four large Dornier aeroplanes, designed especially for the
tremendous altitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added
fuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could transport
our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier to various
suitable inland points, and from these points a sufficient quota of dogs would
serve us.

We planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic season - or longer, if
absolutely necessary - would permit, operating mostly in the mountain ranges
and on the plateau south of Ross Sea; regions explored in varying degree by
Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd. With frequent changes of camp, made
by aeroplane and involving distances great enough to be of geological
significance, we expected to unearth a quite unprecedented amount of material -
especially in the pre-Cambrian strata of which so narrow a range of antarctic
specimens had previously been secured. We wished also to obtain as great as
possible a variety of the upper fossiliferous rocks, since the primal life history of
this bleak realm of ice and death is of the highest importance to our knowledge
of the earth's past. That the antarctic continent was once temperate and even
tropical, with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the lichens, marine
fauna, arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge are the only survivals, is a
matter of common information; and we hoped to expand that information in
variety, accuracy, and detail. When a simple boring revealed fossiliferous signs,
we would enlarge the aperture by blasting, in order to get specimens of suitable
size and condition.

Our borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper
soil or rock, were to be confined to exposed, or nearly exposed, land surfaces -
these inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the mile or two-mile
thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels. We could not afford to waste
drilling the depth of any considerable amount of mere glaciation, though
Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of



borings and melting off limited areas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven
dynamo. It is this plan - which we could not put into effect except experimentally
on an expedition such as ours - that the coming Starkweather-Moore Expedition
proposes to follow, despite the warnings I have issued since our return from the
antarctic.

The public knows of the Miskatonic Expedition through our frequent wireless
reports to the Arkham Advertiser and Associated Press, and through the later
articles of Pabodie and myself. We consisted of four men from the University -
Pabodie, Lake of the biology department, Atwood of the physics department -
also a meteorologist - and myself, representing geology and having nominal
command - besides sixteen assistants: seven graduate students from Miskatonic
and nine skilled mechanics. Of these sixteen, twelve were qualified aeroplane
pilots, all but two of whom were competent wireless operators. Eight of them
understood navigation with compass and sextant, as did Pabodie, Atwood, and
I. In addition, of course, our two ships - wooden ex-whalers, reinforced for ice
conditions and having auxiliary steam - were fully manned.

The Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, aided by a few special contributions,
financed the expedition; hence our preparations were extremely thorough,
despite the absence of great publicity. The dogs, sledges, machines, camp
materials, and unassembled parts of our five planes were delivered in Boston,
and there our ships were loaded. We were marvelously well-equipped for our
specific purposes, and in all matters pertaining to supplies, regimen,
transportation, and camp construction we profited by the excellent example of
our many recent and exceptionally brilliant predecessors. It was the unusual
number and fame of these predecessors which made our own expedition - ample
though it was - so little noticed by the world at large.

As the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbor on September 2nd, 1930,
taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama Canal, and
stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter place we took on final
supplies. None of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before,
hence we all relied greatly on our ship captains - J. B. Douglas, commanding the
brig Arkham, and serving as commander of the sea party, and Georg
Thorfinnssen, commanding the barque Miskatonic - both veteran whalers in
antarctic waters.

As we left the inhabited world behind, the sun sank lower and lower in the
north, and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day. At about 62°
South Latitude we sighted our first icebergs - table-like objects with vertical sides
- and just before reaching the antarctic circle, which we crossed on October 20th
with appropriately quaint ceremonies, we were considerably troubled with field


ice. The falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage
through the tropics, but I tried to brace up for the worse rigors to come. On many
occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly; these including a
strikingly vivid mirage - the first I had ever seen - in which distant bergs became
the battlements of unimaginable cosmic castles.

Pushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive nor thickly
packed, we regained open water at South Latitude 67°, East Longitude 175° On
the morning of October 26th a strong land blink appeared on the south, and
before noon we all felt a thrill of excitement at beholding a vast, lofty, and snow-
clad mountain chain which opened out and covered the whole vista ahead. At
last we had encountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its
cryptic world of frozen death. These peaks were obviously the Admiralty Range
discovered by Ross, and it would now be our task to round Cape Adare and sail
down the east coast of Victoria Land to our contemplated base on the shore of
McMurdo Sound, at the foot of the volcano Erebus in South Latitude 77° 9'.

The last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy-stirring. Great barren peaks of
mystery loomed up constantly against the west as the low northern sun of noon
or the still lower horizon-grazing southern sun of midnight poured its hazy
reddish rays over the white snow, bluish ice and water lanes, and black bits of
exposed granite slope. Through the desolate summits swept ranging,
intermittent gusts of the terrible antarctic wind; whose cadences sometimes held
vague suggestions of a wild and half-sentient musical piping, with notes
extending over a wide range, and which for some subconscious mnemonic
reason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible. Something about the
scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing Asian paintings of Nicholas
Roerich, and of the still stranger and more disturbing descriptions of the evilly
fabled plateau of Leng which occur in the dreaded Necronomicon of the mad
Arab Abdul Alhazred. I was rather sorry, later on, that I had ever looked into
that monstrous book at the college library.

On the 7th of November, sight of the westward range having been temporarily
lost, we passed Franklin Island; and the next day descried the cones of Mts.
Erebus and Terror on Ross Island ahead, with the long line of the Parry
Mountains beyond. There now stretched off to the east the low, white line of the
great ice barrier, rising perpendicularly to a height of two hundred feet like the
rocky cliffs of Quebec, and marking the end of southward navigation. In the
afternoon we entered McMurdo Sound and stood off the coast in the lee of
smoking Mt. Erebus. The scoriae peak towered up some twelve thousand, seven
hundred feet against the eastern sky, like a Japanese print of the sacred Fujiyama,
while beyond it rose the white, ghostlike height of Mt. Terror, ten thousand, nine
hundred feet in altitude, and now extinct as a volcano.

Puffs of smoke from Erebus came intermittently, and one of the graduate
assistants - a brilliant young fellow named Danforth - pointed out what looked
like lava on the snowy slope, remarking that this mountain, discovered in 1840,
had undoubtedly been the source of Poe's image when he wrote seven years
later:

the lavas

Their sulphurous

In the ultimate

That groan as they

In the realms of the boreal pole.

Danforth was a great reader of bizarre material, and had talked a good deal of
Poe. I was interested myself because of the antarctic scene of Poe's only long
story - the disturbing and enigmatical Arthur Gordon Pym. On the barren shore,
and on the lofty ice barrier in the background, myriads of grotesque penguins
squawked and flapped their fins, while many fat seals were visible on the water,
swimming or sprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting ice.

Using small boats, we effected a difficult landing on Ross Island shortly after
midnight on the morning of the 9th, carrying a line of cable from each of the
ships and preparing to unload supplies by means of a breeches-buoy
arrangement. Our sensations on first treading Antarctic soil were poignant and
complex, even though at this particular point the Scott and Shackleton
expeditions had preceded us. Our camp on the frozen shore below the volcano's
slope was only a provisional one, headquarters being kept aboard the Arkham.
We landed all our drilling apparatus, dogs, sledges, tents, provisions, gasoline
tanks, experimental ice-melting outfit, cameras, both ordinary and aerial,
aeroplane parts, and other accessories, including three small portable wireless
outfits - besides those in the planes - capable of communicating with the
Arkham's large outfit from any part of the antarctic continent that we would be
likely to visit. The ship's outfit, communicating with the outside world, was to
convey press reports to the Arkham Advertiser's powerful wireless station on
Kingsport Head, Massachusetts. We hoped to complete our work during a single
antarctic summer; but if this proved impossible, we would winter on the
Arkham, sending the Miskatonic north before the freezing of the ice for another
summer's supplies.

I need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our early
work: of our ascent of Mt. Erebus; our successful mineral borings at several
points on Ross Island and the singular speed with which Pabodie's apparatus
accomplished them, even through solid rock layers; our provisional test of the
small ice-melting equipment; our perilous ascent of the great barrier with sledges





and supplies; and our final assembling of five huge aeroplanes at the camp atop
the barrier. The health of our land party - twenty men and fifty-five Alaskan
sledge dogs - was remarkable, though of course we had so far encountered no
really destructive temperatures or windstorms. For the most part, the
thermometer varied between zero and 20° or 25° above, and our experience with
New England winters had accustomed us to rigors of this sort. The barrier camp
was semi-permanent, and destined to be a storage cache for gasoline, provisions,
dynamite, and other supplies.

Only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material, the
fifth being left with a pilot and two men from the ships at the storage cache to
form a means of reaching us from the Arkham in case all our exploring planes
were lost. Later, when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we
would employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between this cache
and another permanent base on the great plateau from six hundred to seven
hundred miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier. Despite the almost
unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests that pour down from the
plateau, we determined to dispense with intermediate bases, taking our chances
in the interest of economy and probable efficiency.

Wireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking, four-hour, nonstop flight of
our squadron on November 21st over the lofty shelf ice, with vast peaks rising on
the west, and the unfathomed silences echoing to the sound of our engines. Wind
troubled us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us through the
one opaque fog we encountered. When the vast rise loomed ahead, between
Latitudes 83° and 84°, we knew we had reached Beardmore Glacier, the largest
valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen sea was now giving place to a
frowning and mountainous coast line. At last we were truly entering the white,
aeon-dead world of the ultimate south. Even as we realized it we saw the peak of
Mt. Nansen in the eastern distance, towering up to its height of almost fifteen
thousand feet.

The successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in Latitude
86° 7', East Longitude 174° 23', and the phenomenally rapid and effective borings
and blastings made at various points reached by our sledge trips and short
aeroplane flights, are matters of history; as is the arduous and triumphant ascent
of Mt. Nansen by Pabodie and two of the graduate students - Gedney and
Carroll - on December 13 - 15. We were some eight thousand, five hundred feet
above sea-level, and when experimental drillings revealed solid ground only
twelve feet down through the snow and ice at certain points, we made
considerable use of the small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed
dynamiting at many places where no previous explorer had ever thought of
securing mineral specimens. The pre-Cambrian granites and beacon sandstones



thus obtained confirmed our belief that this plateau was homogeneous, with the
great bulk of the continent to the west, but somewhat different from the parts
lying eastward below South America - which we then thought to form a separate
and smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction of Ross
and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since disproved the hypothesis.

In certain of the sandstones, dynamited and chiseled after boring revealed their
nature, we found some highly interesting fossil markings and fragments; notably
ferns, seaweeds, trilobites, crinoids, and such moUusks as linguellae and
gastropods - all of which seemed of real significance in connection with the
region's primordial history. There was also a queer triangular, striated marking,
about a foot in greatest diameter, which Lake pieced together from three
fragments of slate brought up from a deep-blasted aperture. These fragments
came from a point to the westward, near the Queen Alexandra Range; and Lake,
as a biologist, seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and
provocative, though to my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple
effects reasonably common in the sedimentary rocks. Since slate is no more than
a metamorphic formation into which a sedimentary stratum is pressed, and since
the pressure itself produces odd distorting effects on any markings which may
exist, I saw no reason for extreme wonder over the striated depression.

On January 6th, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Danforth, the other six students, and myself
flew directly over the south pole in two of the great planes, being forced down
once by a sudden high wind, which, fortunately, did not develop into a typical
storm. This was, as the papers have stated, one of several observation flights,
during others of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas
unreached by previous explorers. Our early flights were disappointing in this
latter respect, though they afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly
fantastic and deceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our sea voyage
had given us some brief foretastes. Distant mountains floated in the sky as
enchanted cities, and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold,
silver, and scarlet land of Dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under
the magic of the low midnight sun. On cloudy days we had considerable trouble
in flying owing to the tendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one
mystical opalescent void with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the two.

At length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five hundred miles
eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing a fresh sub-base at a
point which would probably be on the smaller continental division, as we
mistakenly conceived it. Geological specimens obtained there would be desirable
for purposes of comparison. Our health so far had remained excellent - lime juice
well offsetting the steady diet of tinned and salted food, and temperatures
generally above zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs. It was now


midsummer, and with haste and care we might be able to conclude work by
March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long antarctic night. Several
savage windstorms had burst upon us from the west, but we had escaped
damage through the skill of Atwood in devising rudimentary aeroplane shelters
and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks, and reinforcing the principal camp
buildings with snow. Our good luck and efficiency had indeed been almost
uncanny.

The outside world knew, of course, of our program, and was told also of Lake's
strange and dogged insistence on a westward - or rather, northwestward -
prospecting trip before our radical shift to the new base. It seems that he had
pondered a great deal, and with alarmingly radical daring, over that triangular
striated marking in the slate; reading into it certain contradictions in nature and
geological period which whetted his curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid
to sink more borings and blastings in the west- stretching formation to which the
exhumed fragments evidently belonged. He was strangely convinced that the
marking was the print of some bulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable
organism of considerably advanced evolution, notwithstanding that the rock
which bore it was of so vastly ancient a date - Cambrian if not actually pre-
Cambrian - as to preclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved
life, but of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite stage. These
fragments, with their odd marking, must have been five hundred million to a
thousand million years old.

II

Popular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless bulletins of
Lake's start northwestward into regions never trodden by human foot or
penetrated by human imagination, though we did not mention his wild hopes of
revolutionizing the entire sciences of biology and geology. His preliminary
sledging and boring journey of January 11th to 18th with Pabodie and five others
- marred by the loss of two dogs in an upset when crossing one of the great
pressure ridges in the ice - had brought up more and more of the Archaean slate;
and even I was interested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in
that unbelievably ancient stratum. These markings, however, were of very
primitive life forms involving no great paradox except that any life forms should
occur in rock as definitely pre-Cambrian as this seemed to be; hence I still failed
to see the good sense of Lake's demand for an interlude in our time- saving
program - an interlude requiring the use of all four planes, many men, and the
whole of the expedition's mechanical apparatus. I did not, in the end, veto the
plan, though I decided not to accompany the northwestward party despite
Lake's plea for my geological advice. While they were gone, I would remain at
the base with Pabodie and five men and work out final plans for the eastward



shift. In preparation for this transfer, one of the planes had begun to move up a
good gasohne supply from McMurdo Sound; but this could wait temporarily. I
kept with me one sledge and nine dogs, since it is unwise to be at any time
without possible transportation in an utterly tenantless world of aeon-long
death.

Lake's sub-expedition into the unknown, as everyone will recall, sent out its own
reports from the shortwave transmitters on the planes; these being
simultaneously picked up by our apparatus at the southern base and by the
Arkham at McMurdo Sound, whence they were relayed to the outside world on
wave lengths up to fifty meters. The start was made January 22nd at 4 A.M., and
the first wireless message we received came only two hours later, when Lake
spoke of descending and starting a small- scale ice-melting and bore at a point
some three hundred miles away from us. Six hours after that a second and very
excited message told of the frantic, beaver-like work whereby a shallow shaft
had been sunk and blasted, culminating in the discovery of slate fragments with
several markings approximately like the one which had caused the original
puzzlement.

Three hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the flight in the
teeth of a raw and piercing gale; and when I dispatched a message of protest
against further hazards. Lake replied curtly that his new specimens made any
hazard worth taking. I saw that his excitement had reached the point of mutiny,
and that I could do nothing to check this headlong risk of the whole expedition's
success; but it was appalling to think of his plunging deeper and deeper into that
treacherous and sinister white immensity of tempests and unfathomed mysteries
which stretched off for some fifteen hundred miles to the half-known, half-
suspected coast line of Queen Mary and Knox Lands.

Then, in about an hour and a half more, came that doubly excited message from
Lake's moving plane, which almost reversed my sentiments and made me wish I
had accompanied the party:

"10:05 P.M. On the wing. After snowstorm, have spied mountain range ahead
higher than any hitherto seen. May equal Himalayas, allowing for height of
plateau. Probable Latitude 76° 15', Longitude 113° 10' E. Reaches far as can see to
right and left. Suspicion of two smoking cones. All peaks black and bare of snow.
Gale blowing off them impedes navigation."

After that Pabodie, the men and I hung breathlessly over the receiver. Thought of
this titanic mountain rampart seven hundred miles away inflamed our deepest
sense of adventure; and we rejoiced that our expedition, if not ourselves
personally, had been its discoverers. In half an hour Lake called us again:


"Moulton's plane forced down on plateau in foothills, but nobody hurt and
perhaps can repair. Shall transfer essentials to other three for return or further
moves if necessary, but no more heavy plane travel needed just now. Mountains
surpass anything in imagination. Am going up scouting in Carroll's plane, with
all weight out.

"You can't imagine anything like this. Highest peaks must go over thirty-five
thousand feet. Everest out of the running. Atwood to work out height with
theodolite while Carroll and I go up. Probably wrong about cones, for formations
look stratified. Possibly pre-Cambrian slate with other strata mixed in. Queer
skyline effects - regular sections of cubes clinging to highest peaks. Whole thing
marvelous in red-gold light of low sun. Like land of mystery in a dream or
gateway to forbidden world of untrodden wonder. Wish you were here to
study."

Though it was technically sleeping time, not one of us listeners thought for a
moment of retiring. It must have been a good deal the same at McMurdo Sound,
where the supply cache and the Arkham were also getting the messages; for
Captain Douglas gave out a call congratulating everybody on the important find,
and Sherman, the cache operator, seconded his sentiments. We were sorry, of
course, about the damaged aeroplane, but hoped it could be easily mended.
Then, at 11 P.M., came another call from Lake:

"Up with Carroll over highest foothills. Don't dare try really tall peaks in present
weather, but shall later. Frightful work climbing, and hard going at this altitude,
but worth it. Great range fairly solid, hence can't get any glimpses beyond. Main
summits exceed Himalayas, and very queer. Range looks like pre-Cambrian
slate, with plain signs of many other upheaved strata. Was wrong about
volcanism. Goes farther in either direction than we can see. Swept clear of snow
above about twenty-one thousand feet.

"Odd formations on slopes of highest mountains. Great low square blocks with
exactly vertical sides, and rectangular lines of low, vertical ramparts, like the old
Asian castles clinging to steep mountains in Roerich's paintings. Impressive from
distance. Flew close to some, and Carroll thought they were formed of smaller
separate pieces, but that is probably weathering. Most edges crumbled and
rounded off as if exposed to storms and climate changes for millions of years.
"Parts, especially upper parts, seem to be of lighter-colored rock than any visible
strata on slopes proper, hence of evidently crystalline origin. Close flying shows
many cave mouths, some unusually regular in outline, square or semicircular.
You must come and investigate. Think I saw rampart squarely on top of one
peak. Height seems about thirty thousand to thirty-five thousand feet. Am up
twenty-one thousand, five hundred myself, in devilish, gnawing cold. Wind


whistles and pipes through passes and in and out of caves, but no flying danger
so far."

From then on for another half hour Lake kept up a running fire of comment, and
expressed his intention of climbing some of the peaks on foot. I replied that I
would join him as soon as he could send a plane, and that Pabodie and I would
work out the best gasoline plan - just where and how to concentrate our supply
in view of the expedition's altered character. Obviously, Lake's boring
operations, as well as his aeroplane activities, would require a great deal for the
new base which he planned to establish at the foot of the mountains; and it was
possible that the eastward flight might not be made, after all, this season. In
connection with this business I called Captain Douglas and asked him to get as
much as possible out of the ships and up the barrier with the single dog team we
had left there. A direct route across the unknown region between Lake and
McMurdo Sound was what we really ought to establish.

Lake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay where
Moulton's plane had been forced down, and where repairs had already
progressed somewhat. The ice sheet was very thin, with dark ground here and
there visible, and he would sink some borings and blasts at that very point before
making any sledge trips or climbing expeditions. He spoke of the ineffable
majesty of the whole scene, and the queer state of his sensations at being in the
lee of vast, silent pinnacles whose ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at
the world's rim. Atwood's theodolite observations had placed the height of the
five tallest peaks at from thirty thousand to thirty-four thousand feet. The
windswept nature of the terrain clearly disturbed Lake, for it argued the
occasional existence of prodigious gales, violent beyond anything we had so far
encountered. His camp lay a little more than five miles from where the higher
foothills rose abruptly. I could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm in his
words-flashed across a glacial void of seven hundred miles - as he urged that we
all hasten with the matter and get the strange, new region disposed of as soon as
possible. He was about to rest now, after a continuous day's work of almost
unparalleled speed, strenuousness, and results.

In the morning I had a three-cornered wireless talk with Lake and Captain
Douglas at their widely separated bases. It was agreed that one of Lake's planes
would come to my base for Pabodie, the five men, and myself, as well as for all
the fuel it could carry. The rest of the fuel question, depending on our decision
about an easterly trip, could wait for a few days, since Lake had enough for
immediate camp heat and borings. Eventually the old southern base ought to be
restocked, but if we postponed the easterly trip we would not use it till the next
summer, and, meanwhile. Lake must send a plane to explore a direct route
between his new mountains and McMurdo Sound.


Pabodie and I prepared to close our base for a short or long period, as the case
might be. If we wintered in the antarctic we would probably fly straight from
Lake's base to the Arkham without returning to this spot. Some of our conical
tents had already been reinforced by blocks of hard snow, and now we decided
to complete the job of making a permanent village. Owing to a very liberal tent
supply. Lake had with him all that his base would need, even after our arrival. I
wirelessed that Pabodie and I would be ready for the northwestward move after
one day's work and one night's rest.

Our labors, however, were not very steady after 4 P.M., for about that time Lake
began sending in the most extraordinary and excited messages. His working day
had started unpropitiously, since an aeroplane survey of the nearly-exposed rock
surfaces showed an entire absence of those Archaean and primordial strata for
which he was looking, and which formed so great a part of the colossal peaks
that loomed up at a tantalizing distance from the camp. Most of the rocks
glimpsed were apparently Jurassic and Comanchian sandstones and Permian
and Triassic schists, with now and then a glossy black outcropping suggesting a
hard and slaty coal. This rather discouraged Lake, whose plans all hinged on
unearthing specimens more than five hundred million years older. It was clear to
him that in order to recover the Archaean slate vein in which he had found the
odd markings, he would have to make a long sledge trip from these foothills to
the steep slopes of the gigantic mountains themselves.

He had resolved, nevertheless, to do some local boring as part of the expedition's
general program; hence he set up the drill and put five men to work with it while
the rest finished settling the camp and repairing the damaged aeroplane. The
softest visible rock - a sandstone about a quarter of a mile from the camp - had
been chosen for the first sampling; and the drill made excellent progress without
much supplementary blasting. It was about three hours afterward, following the
first really heavy blast of the operation, that the shouting of the drill crew was
heard; and that young Gedney - the acting foreman - rushed into the camp with
the startling news.

They had struck a cave. Early in the boring the sandstone had given place to a
vein of Comanchian limestone, full of minute fossil cephalopods, corals, echini,
and spirifera, and with occasional suggestions of siliceous sponges and marine
vertebrate bones - the latter probably of teleosts, sharks, and ganoids. This, in
itself, was important enough, as affording the first vertebrate fossils the
expedition had yet secured; but when shortly afterward the drill head dropped
through the stratum into apparent vacancy, a wholly new and doubly intense
wave of excitement spread among the excavators. A good-sized blast had laid
open the subterrene secret; and now, through a jagged aperture perhaps five feet
across and three feet thick, there yawned before the avid searchers a section of



shallow limestone hollowing worn more than fifty million years ago by the
trickling ground waters of a bygone tropic world.

The hollowed layer was not more than seven or eight feet deep but extended off
indefinitely in all directions and had a fresh, slightly moving air which suggested
its membership in an extensive subterranean system. Its roof and floor were
abundantly equipped with large stalactites and stalagmites, some of which met
in columnar form: but important above all else was the vast deposit of shells and
bones, which in places nearly choked the passage. Washed down from unknown
jungles of Mesozoic tree ferns and fungi, and forests of Tertiary cycads, fan
palms, and primitive angiosperms, this osseous medley contained
representatives of more Cretaceous, Eocene, and other animal species than the
greatest paleontologist could have counted or classified in a year. Mollusks,
crustacean armor, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and early mammals - great
and small, known and unknown. No wonder Gedney ran back to the camp
shouting, and no wonder everyone else dropped work and rushed headlong
through the biting cold to where the tall derrick marked a new-found gateway to
secrets of inner earth and vanished aeons.

When Lake had satisfied the first keen edge of his curiosity, he scribbled a
message in his notebook and had young Moulton run back to the camp to
dispatch it by wireless. This was my first word of the discovery, and it told of the
identification of early shells, bones of ganoids and placoderms, remnants of
labyrinthodonts and thecodonts, great mosasaur skull fragments, dinosaur
vertebrae and armor plates, pterodactyl teeth and wing bones, Archaeopteryx
debris, Miocene sharks' teeth, primitive bird skulls, and other bones of archaic
mammals such as palaeotheres, Xiphodons, Eohippi, Oreodons, and titanotheres.
There was nothing as recent as a mastodon, elephant, true camel, deer, or bovine
animal; hence Lake concluded that the last deposits had occurred during the
Oligocene Age, and that the hollowed stratum had lain in its present dried, dead,
and inaccessible state for at least thirty million years.

On the other hand, the prevalence of very early life forms was singular in the
highest degree. Though the limestone formation was, on the evidence of such
typical imbedded fossils as ventriculites, positively and unmistakably
Comanchian and not a particle earlier, the free fragments in the hollow space
included a surprising proportion from organisms hitherto considered as peculiar
to far older periods - even rudimentary fishes, mollusks, and corals as remote as
the Silunan or Ordovician. The inevitable inference was that in this part of the
world there had been a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between the
life of over three hundred million years ago and that of only thirty million years
ago. How far this continuity had extended beyond the Oligocene Age when the
cavern was closed was of course past all speculation. In any event, the coming of



the frightful ice in the Pleistocene some five hundred thousand years ago - a
mere yesterday as compared with the age of this cavity - must have put an end to
any of the primal forms which had locally managed to outlive their common
terms.

Lake was not content to let his first message stand, but had another bulletin
written and dispatched across the snow to the camp before Moulton could get
back. After that Moulton stayed at the wireless in one of the planes, transmitting
to me - and to the Arkham for relaying to the outside world - the frequent
postscripts which Lake sent him by a succession of messengers. Those who
followed the newspapers will remember the excitement created among men of
science by that afternoon's reports - reports which have finally led, after all these
years, to the organization of that very Starkweather-Moore Expedition which I
am so anxious to dissuade from its purposes. I had better give the messages
literally as Lake sent them, and as our base operator McTighe translated them
from the pencil shorthand:

"Fowler makes discovery of highest importance in sandstone and limestone
fragments from blasts. Several distinct triangular striated prints like those in
Archaean slate, proving that source survived from over six hundred million
years ago to Comanchian times without more than moderate morphological
changes and decrease in average size. Comanchian prints apparently more
primitive or decadent, if anything, than older ones. Emphasize importance of
discovery in press. Will mean to biology what Einstein has meant to mathematics
and physics. Joins up with my previous work and amplifies conclusions.

"Appears to indicate, as I suspected, that earth has seen whole cycle or cycles of
organic life before known one that begins with Archaeozoic cells. Was evolved
and specialized not later than a thousand million years ago, when planet was
young and recently uninhabitable for any life forms or normal protoplasmic
structure. Question arises when, where, and how development took place."

"Later. Examining certain skeletal fragments of large land and marine saurians
and primitive mammals, find singular local wounds or injuries to bony structure
not attributable to any known predatory or carnivorous animal of any period, of
two sorts - straight, penetrant bores, and apparently hacking incisions. One or
two cases of cleanly severed bones. Not many specimens affected. Am sending to
camp for electric torches. Will extend search area underground by hacking away
stalactites."

"Still later. Have found peculiar soapstone fragment about six inches across and
an inch and a half thick, wholly unlike any visible local formation - greenish, but
no evidences to place its period. Has curious smoothness and regularity. Shaped



like five-pointed star with tips broken off, and signs of other cleavage at inward
angles and in center of surface. Small, smooth depression in center of unbroken
surface. Arouses much curiosity as to source and weathering. Probably some
freak of water action. Carroll, with magnifier, thinks he can make out additional
markings of geologic significance. Groups of tiny dots in regular patterns. Dogs
growing uneasy as we work, and seem to hate this soapstone. Must see if it has
any peculiar odor. Will report again when Mills gets back with light and we start
on underground area."

"10:15 P.M. Important discovery. Orrendorf and Watkins, working underground
at 9:45 with light, found monstrous barrel-shaped fossil of wholly unknown
nature; probably vegetable unless overgrown specimen of unknown marine
radiata. Tissue evidently preserved by mineral salts. Tough as leather, but
astonishing flexibility retained in places. Marks of broken-off parts at ends and
around sides. Six feet end to end, three and five- tenths feet central diameter,
tapering to one foot at each end. Like a barrel with five bulging ridges in place of
staves. Lateral breakages, as of thinnish stalks, are at equator in middle of these
ridges. In furrows between ridges are curious growths - combs or wings that fold
up and spread out like fans. All greatly damaged but one, which gives almost
seven-foot wing spread. Arrangement reminds one of certain monsters of primal
myth, especially fabled Elder Things in Necronomicon.

"Their wings seem to be membranous, stretched on frame work of glandular
tubing. Apparent minute orifices in frame tubing at wing tips. Ends of body
shriveled, giving no clue to interior or to what has been broken off there. Must
dissect when we get back to camp. Can't decide whether vegetable or animal.
Many features obviously of almost incredible primitiveness. Have set all hands
cutting stalactites and looking for further specimens. Additional scarred bones
found, but these must wait. Having trouble with dogs. They can't endure the
new specimen, and would probably tear it to pieces if we didn't keep it at a
distance from them."

"11:30 P.M. Attention, Dyer, Pabodie, Douglas. Matter of highest - I might say
transcendent - importance. Arkham must relay to Kingsport Head Station at
once. Strange barrel growth is the Archaean thing that left prints in rocks. Mills,
Boudreau, and Fowler discover cluster of thirteen more at underground point
forty feet from aperture. Mixed with curiously rounded and configured
soapstone fragments smaller than one previously found - star-shaped, but no
marks of breakage except at some of the points.

"Of organic specimens, eight apparently perfect, with all appendages. Have
brought all to surface, leading off dogs to distance. They cannot stand the things.



Give close attention to description and repeat back for accuracy Papers must get
this right.

"Objects are eight feet long all over. Six-foot, five-ridged barrel torso three and
five-tenths feet central diameter, one foot end diameters. Dark gray, flexible, and
infinitely tough. Seven-foot membranous wings of same color, found folded,
spread out of furrows between ridges. Wing framework tubular or glandular, of
lighter gray, with orifices at wing tips. Spread wings have serrated edge. Around
equator, one at central apex of each of the five vertical, stave-like ridges are five
systems of light gray flexible arms or tentacles found tightly folded to torso but
expansible to maximum length of over three feet. Like arms of primitive crinoid.
Single stalks three inches diameter branch after six inches into five substalks,
each of which branches after eight inches into small, tapering tentacles or
tendrils, giving each stalk a total of twenty-five tentacles.

"At top of torso blunt, bulbous neck of lighter gray, with gill-like suggestions,
holds yellowish five-pointed starfish-shaped apparent head covered with three-
inch wiry cilia of various prismatic colors.

"Head thick and puffy, about two feet point to point, with three-inch flexible
yellowish tubes projecting from each point. Slit in exact center of top probably
breathing aperture. At end of each tube is spherical expansion where yellowish
membrane rolls back on handling to reveal glassy, red-irised globe, evidently an
eye.

"Five slightly longer reddish tubes start from inner angles of starfish-shaped
head and end in saclike swellings of same color which, upon pressure, open to
bell-shaped orifices two inches maximum diameter and lined with sharp, white
tooth like projections - probably mouths. All these tubes, cilia, and points of
starfish head, found folded tightly down; tubes and points clinging to bulbous
neck and torso. Flexibility surprising despite vast toughness.

"At bottom of torso, rough but dissimilarly functioning counterparts of head
arrangements exist. Bulbous light-gray pseudo-neck, without gill suggestions,
holds greenish five-pointed starfish arrangement.

"Tough, muscular arms four feet long and tapering from seven inches diameter
at base to about two and five-tenths at point. To each point is attached small end
of a greenish five- veined membranous triangle eight inches long and six wide at
farther end. This is the paddle, fin, or pseudofoot which has made prints in rocks
from a thousand million to fifty or sixty million years old.



"From inner angles of starfish arrangement project two-foot reddish tubes
tapering from three inches diameter at base to one at tip. Orifices at tips. All
these parts infinitely tough and leathery, but extremely flexible. Four-foot arms
with paddles undoubtedly used for locomotion of some sort, marine or
otherwise. When moved, display suggestions of exaggerated muscularity. As
found, all these projections tightly folded over pseudoneck and end of torso,
corresponding to projections at other end.

"Cannot yet assign positively to animal or vegetable kingdom, but odds now
favor animal. Probably represents incredibly advanced evolution of radiata
without loss of certain primitive features. Echinoderm resemblances
unmistakable despite local contradictory evidences.

"Wing structure puzzles in view of probable marine habitat, but may have use in
water navigation. Symmetry is curiously vegetablelike, suggesting vegetable 's
essential up-and- down structure rather than animal's fore-and-aft structure.
Fabulously early date of evolution, preceding even simplest Archaean protozoa
hitherto known, baffles all conjecture as to origin.

"Complete specimens have such uncanny resemblance to certain creatures of
primal myth that suggestion of ancient existence outside antarctic becomes
inevitable. Dyer and Pabodie have read Necronomicon and seen Clark Ashton
Smith's nightmare paintings based on text, and will understand when I speak of
Elder Things supposed to have created all earth life as jest or mistake. Students
have always thought conception formed from morbid imaginative treatment of
very ancient tropical radiata. Also like prehistoric folklore things Wilmarth has
spoken of - Cthulhu cult appendages, etc.

"Vast field of study opened. Deposits probably of late Cretaceous or early Eocene
period, judging from associated specimens. Massive stalagmites deposited above
them. Hard work hewing out, but toughness prevented damage. State of
preservation miraculous, evidently owing to limestone action. No more found so
far, but will resume search later. Job now to get fourteen huge specimens to camp
without dogs, which bark furiously and can't be trusted near them.

"With nine men - three left to guard the dogs - we ought to manage the three
sledges fairly well, though wind is bad. Must establish plane communication
with McMurdo Sound and begin shipping material. But I've got to dissect one of
these things before we take any rest. Wish I had a real laboratory here. Dyer
better kick himself for having tried to stop my westward trip. First the world's
greatest mountains, and then this. If this last isn't the high spot of the expedition,
I don't know what is. We're made scientifically. Congrats, Pabodie, on the drill
that opened up the cave. Now will Arkham please repeat description?"




The sensations of Pabodie and myself at receipt of this report were almost
beyond description, nor were our companions much behind us in enthusiasm.
McTighe, who had hastily translated a few high spots as they came from the
droning receiving set, wrote out the entire message from his shorthand version
as soon as Lake's operator signed off. All appreciated the epoch-making
significance of the discovery, and I sent Lake congratulations as soon as the
Arkham's operator had repeated back the descriptive parts as requested; and my
example was followed by Sherman from his station at the McMurdo Sound
supply cache, as well as by Captain Douglas of the Arkham. Later, as head of the
expedition, I added some remarks to be relayed through the Arkham to the
outside world. Of course, rest was an absurd thought amidst this excitement; and
my only wish was to get to Lake's camp as quickly as I could. It disappointed me
when he sent word that a rising mountain gale made early aerial travel
impossible.

But within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish disappointment. Lake,
sending more messages, told of the completely successful transportation of the
fourteen great specimens to the camp. It had been a hard pull, for the things were
surprisingly heavy; but nine men had accomplished it very neatly. Now some of
the party were hurriedly building a snow corral at a safe distance from the camp,
to which the dogs could be brought for greater convenience in feeding. The
specimens were laid out on the hard snow near the camp, save for one on which
Lake was making crude attempts at dissection.

This dissection seemed to be a greater task than had been expected, for, despite
the heat of a gasoline stove in the newly raised laboratory tent, the deceptively
flexible tissues of the chosen specimen - a powerful and intact one - lost nothing
of their more than leathery toughness. Lake was puzzled as to how he might
make the requisite incisions without violence destructive enough to upset all the
structural niceties he was looking for. He had, it is true, seven more perfect
specimens; but these were too few to use up recklessly unless the cave might
later yield an unlimited supply. Accordingly he removed the specimen and
dragged in one which, though having remnants of the starfish arrangements at
both ends, was badly crushed and partly disrupted along one of the great torso
furrows.

Results, quickly reported over the wireless, were baffling and provocative
indeed. Nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with instruments hardly
able to cut the anomalous tissue, but the little that was achieved left us all awed
and bewildered. Existing biology would have to be wholly revised, for this thing
was no product of any cell growth science knows about. There had been scarcely
any mineral replacement, and despite an age of perhaps forty million years, the
internal organs were wholly intact. The leathery, undeteriorative, and almost


indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the thing's form of
organization, and pertained to some paleogean cycle of invertebrate evolution
utterly beyond our powers of speculation. At first all that Lake found was dry,
but as the heated tent produced its thawing effect, organic moisture of pungent
and offensive odor was encountered toward the thing's uninjured side. It was
not blood, but a thick, dark-green fluid apparently answering the same purpose.
By the time Lake reached this stage, all thirty-seven dogs had been brought to the
still uncompleted corral near the camp, and even at that distance set up a savage
barking and show of restlessness at the acrid, diffusive smell.

Far from helping to place the strange entity, this provisional dissection merely
deepened its mystery. All guesses about its external members had been correct,
and on the evidence of these one could hardly hesitate to call the thing animal;
but internal inspection brought up so many vegetable evidences that Lake was
left hopelessly at sea. It had digestion and circulation, and eliminated waste
matter through the reddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base. Cursorily, one
would say that its respiration apparatus handled oxygen rather than carbon
dioxide, and there were odd evidences of air-storage chambers and methods of
shifting respiration from the external orifice to at least two other fully developed
breathing systems - gills and pores. Clearly, it was amphibian, and probably
adapted to long airless hibernation periods as well. Vocal organs seemed present
in connection with the main respiratory system, but they presented anomalies
beyond immediate solution. Articulate speech, in the sense of syllable utterance,
seemed barely conceivable, but musical piping notes covering a wide range were
highly probable. The muscular system was almost prematurely developed.

The nervous system was so complex and highly developed as to leave Lake
aghast. Though excessively primitive and archaic in some respects, the thing had
a set of ganglial centers and connectives arguing the very extremes of specialized
development. Its five-lobed brain was surprisingly advanced, and there were
signs of a sensory equipment, served in part through the wiry cilia of the head,
involving factors alien to any other terrestrial organism. Probably it has more
than five senses, so that its habits could not be predicted from any existing
analogy. It must. Lake thought, have been a creature of keen sensitiveness and
delicately differentiated functions in its primal world - much like the ants and
bees of today. It reproduced like the vegetable cryptogams, especially the
Pteridophyta, having spore cases at the tips of the wings and evidently
developing from a thallus or prothallus.

But to give it a name at this stage was mere folly. It looked like a radiate, but was
clearly something more. It was partly vegetable, but had three-fourths of the
essentials of animal structure. That it was marine in origin, its symmetrical
contour and certain other attributes clearly indicated; yet one could not be exact



as to the limit of its later adaptations. The wings, after all, held a persistent
suggestion of the aerial. How it could have undergone its tremendously complex
evolution on a new-born earth in time to leave prints in Archaean rocks was so
far beyond conception as to make Lake whimsically recall the primal myths
about Great Old Ones who filtered down from the stars and concocted earth life
as a joke or mistake; and the wild tales of cosmic hill things from outside told by
a folklorist colleague in Miskatonic's English department.

Naturally, he considered the possibility of the pre-Cambrian prints having been
made by a less evolved ancestor of the present specimens, but quickly rejected
this too-facile theory upon considering the advanced structural qualities of the
older fossils. If anything, the later contours showed decadence rather than higher
evolution. The size of the pseudofeet had decreased, and the whole morphology
seemed coarsened and simplified. Moreover, the nerves and organs just
examined held singular suggestions of retrogression from forms still more
complex. Atrophied and vestigial parts were surprisingly prevalent. Altogether,
little could be said to have been solved; and Lake fell back on mythology for a
provisional name - jocosely dubbing his finds "The Elder Ones."

At about 2:30 A.M., having decided to postpone further work and get a little rest,
he covered the dissected organism with a tarpaulin, emerged from the laboratory
tent, and studied the intact specimens with renewed interest. The ceaseless
antarctic sun had begun to limber up their tissues a trifle, so that the head points
and tubes of two or three showed signs of unfolding; but Lake did not believe
there was any danger of immediate decomposition in the almost subzero air. He
did, however, move all the undissected specimens close together and throw a
spare tent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays. That would also
help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs, whose hostile unrest was
really becoming a problem, even at their substantial distance and behind the
higher and higher snow walls which an increased quota of the men were
hastening to raise around their quarters. He had to weight down the corners of
the tent cloth with heavy blocks of snow to hold it in place amidst the rising gale,
for the titan mountains seemed about to deliver some gravely severe blasts. Early
apprehensions about sudden antarctic winds were revived, and under Atwood's
supervision precautions were taken to bank the tents, new dog corral, and crude
aeroplane shelters with snow on the mountainward side. These latter shelters,
begun with hard snow blocks during odd moments, were by no means as high as
they should have been; and Lake finally detached all hands from other tasks to
work on them.

It was after four when Lake at last prepared to sign off and advised us all to
share the rest period his outfit would take when the shelter walls were a little
higher. He held some friendly chat with Pabodie over the ether, and repeated his


praise of the really marvelous drills that had helped him make his discovery.
Atwood also sent greetings and praises. I gave Lake a warm word of
congratulations, owning up that he was right about the western trip, and we all
agreed to get in touch by wireless at ten in the morning. If the gale was then
over. Lake would send a plane for the party at my base. Just before retiring I
dispatched a final message to the Arkham with instructions about toning down
the day's news for the outside world, since the full details seemed radical enough
to rouse a wave of incredulity until further substantiated.

Ill

None of us, I imagine, slept very heavily or continuously that morning. Both the
excitement of Lake's discovery and the mounting fury of the wind were against
such a thing. So savage was the blast, even where we were, that we could not
help wondering how much worse it was at Lake's camp, directly under the vast
unknown peaks that bred and delivered it. McTighe was awake at ten o'clock
and tried to get Lake on the wireless, as agreed, but some electrical condition in
the disturbed air to the westward seemed to prevent communication. We did,
however, get the Arkham, and Douglas told me that he had likewise been vainly
trying to reach Lake. He had not known about the wind, for very little was
blowing at McMurdo Sound, despite its persistent rage where we were.

Throughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get Lake at intervals,
but invariably without results. About noon a positive frenzy of wind stampeded
out of the west, causing us to fear for the safety of our camp; but it eventually
died down, with only a moderate relapse at 2 P.M. After three o'clock it was very
quiet, and we redoubled our efforts to get Lake. Reflecting that he had four
planes, each provided with an excellent short-wave outfit, we could not imagine
any ordinary accident capable of crippling all his wireless equipment at once.
Nevertheless the stony silence continued, and when we thought of the delirious
force the wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the more
direful conjectures.

By six o'clock our fears had become intense and definite, and after a wireless
consultation with Douglas and Thorfinnssen I resolved to take steps toward
investigation. The fifth aeroplane, which we had left at the McMurdo Sound
supply cache with Sherman and two sailors, was in good shape and ready for
instant use, and it seemed that the very emergency for which it had been saved
was now upon us. I got Sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with
the plane and the two sailors at the southern base as quickly as possible, the air
conditions being apparently highly favorable. We then talked over the personnel
of the coming investigation party, and decided that we would include all hands,
together with the sledge and dogs which I had kept with me. Even so great a



load would not be too much for one of the huge planes built to our special orders
for heavy machinery transportation. At intervals I still tried to reach Lake with
the wireless, but all to no purpose.

Sherman, with the sailors Gunnarsson and Larsen, took off at 7:30, and reported
a quiet flight from several points on the wing. They arrived at our base at
midnight, and all hands at once discussed the next move. It was risky business
sailing over the antarctic in a single aeroplane without any line of bases, but no
one drew back from what seemed like the plainest necessity. We turned in at two
o'clock for a brief rest after some preliminary loading of the plane, but were up
again in four hours to finish the loading and packing.

At 7:15 A.M., January 25th, we started flying northwestward under McTighe's
pilotage with ten men, seven dogs, a sledge, a fuel and food supply, and other
items including the plane's wireless outfit. The atmosphere was clear, fairly
quiet, and relatively mild in temperature, and we anticipated very little trouble
in reaching the latitude and longitude designated by Lake as the site of his camp.
Our apprehensions were over what we might find, or fail to find, at the end of
our journey, for silence continued to answer all calls dispatched to the camp.

Every incident of that four-and-a-half-hour flight is burned into my recollection
because of its crucial position in my life. It marked my loss, at the age of fifty-
four, of all that peace and balance which the normal mind possesses through its
accustomed conception of external nature and nature's laws. Thenceforward the
ten of us - but the student Danforth and myself above all others - were to face a
hideously amplified world of lurking horrors which nothing can erase from our
emotions, and which we would refrain from sharing with mankind in general if
we could. The newspapers have printed the bulletins we sent from the moving
plane, telling of our nonstop course, our two battles with treacherous upper-air
gales, our glimpse of the broken surface where Lake had sunk his mid-journey
shaft three days before, and our sight of a group of those strange fluffy snow
cylinders noted by Amundsen and Byrd as rolling in the wind across the endless
leagues of frozen plateau. There came a point, though, when our sensations
could not be conveyed in any words the press would understand, and a latter
point when we had to adopt an actual rule of strict censorship.

The sailor Larsen was first to spy the jagged line of witchlike cones and pinnacles
ahead, and his shouts sent everyone to the windows of the great cabined plane.
Despite our speed, they were very slow in gaining prominence; hence we knew
that they must be infinitely far off, and visible only because of their abnormal
height. Little by little, however, they rose grimly into the western sky; allowing
us to distinguish various bare, bleak, blackish summits, and to catch the curious
sense of fantasy which they inspired as seen in the reddish antarctic light against


the provocative background of iridescent ice-dust clouds. In the whole spectacle
there was a persistent, pervasive hint of stupendous secrecy and potential
revelation. It was as if these stark, nightmare spires marked the pylons of a
frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of dream, and complex gulfs of remote
time, space, and ultra-dimensionality. I could not help feeling that they were evil
things - mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some
accursed ultimate abyss. That seething, half-luminous cloud background held
ineffable suggestions of a vague, ethereal beyondness far more than terrestrially
spatial, and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness, separateness,
desolation, and aeon-long death of this untrodden and unfathomed austral
world.

It was young Danforth who drew our notice to the curious regularities of the
higher mountain skyline - regularities like clinging fragments of perfect cubes,
which Lake had mentioned in his messages, and which indeed justified his
comparison with the dreamlike suggestions of primordial temple ruins, on
cloudy Asian mountaintops so subtly and strangely painted by Roerich. There
was indeed something hauntingly Roerich-like about this whole unearthly
continent of mountainous mystery. I had felt it in October when we first caught
sight of Victoria Land, and I felt it afresh now. I felt, too, another wave of uneasy
consciousness of Archaean mythical resemblances; of how disturbingly this
lethal realm corresponded to the evilly famed plateau of Leng in the primal
writings. Mythologists have placed Leng in Central Asia; but the racial memory
of man - or of his predecessors - is long, and it may well be that certain tales have
come down from lands and mountains and temples of horror earlier than Asia
and earlier than any human world we know. A few daring mystics have hinted
at a pre-Pleistocene origin for the fragmentary Pnakotic Manuscripts, and have
suggested that the devotees of Tsathoggua were as alien to mankind as
Tsathoggua itself. Leng, wherever in space or time it might brood, was not a
region I would care to be in or near, nor did I relish the proximity of a world that
had ever bred such ambiguous and Archaean monstrosities as those Lake had
just mentioned. At the moment I felt sorry that I had ever read the abhorred
Necronomicon, or talked so much with that unpleasantly erudite folklorist
Wilmarth at the university.

This mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre mirage
which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith as we drew near the
mountains and began to make out the cumulative undulations of the foothills. I
had seen dozens of polar mirages during the preceding weeks, some of them
quite as uncanny and fantastically vivid as the present example; but this one had
a wholly novel and obscure quality of menacing symbolism, and I shuddered as
the seething labyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of
the troubled ice vapors above our heads.


The effect was that of a Cyclopean city of no architecture known to man or to
human imagination, with vast aggregations of night-black masonry embodying
monstrous perversions of geometrical laws. There were truncated cones,
sometimes terraced or fluted, surmounted by tall cylindrical shafts here and
there bulbously enlarged and often capped with tiers of thinnish scalloped disks;
and strange beetling, table-like constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous
rectangular slabs or circular plates or five-pointed stars with each one
overlapping the one beneath. There were composite cones and pyramids either
alone or surmounting cylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids,
and occasional needle-like spires in curious clusters of five. All of these febrile
structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges crossing from one to the other
at various dizzy heights, and the implied scale of the whole was terrifying and
oppressive in its sheer gigantism. The general type of mirage was not unlike
some of the wilder forms observed and drawn by the arctic whaler Scoresby in
1820, but at this time and place, with those dark, unknown mountain peaks
soaring stupendously ahead, that anomalous elder-world discovery in our
minds, and the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our
expedition, we all seemed to find in it a taint of latent malignity and infinitely
evil portent.

I was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process the various
nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted, temporary forms of even vaster
hideousness. As the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began
to look earthward again, and saw that our journey's end was not far off. The
unknown mountains ahead rose dizzily up like a fearsome rampart of giants,
their curious regularities showing with startling clearness even without a field
glass. We were over the lowest foothills now, and could see amidst the snow, ice,
and bare patches of their main plateau a couple of darkish spots which we took
to be Lake's camp and boring. The higher foothills shot up between five and six
miles away, forming a range almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than
Himalayan peaks beyond them. At length Ropes - the student who had relieved
McTighe at the controls - began to head downward toward the left-hand dark
spot whose size marked it as the camp. As he did so, McTighe sent out the last
uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from our expedition.

Everyone, of course, has read the brief and unsatisfying bulletins of the rest of
our antarctic sojourn. Some hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of
the tragedy we found, and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole
Lake party by the frightful wind of the preceding day, or of the night before that.
Eleven known dead, young Gedney missing. People pardoned our hazy lack of
details through realization of the shock the sad event must have caused us, and
believed us when we explained that the mangling action of the wind had
rendered all eleven bodies unsuitable for transportation outside. Indeed, I flatter



myself that even in the midst of our distress, utter bewilderment, and soul-
clutching horror, we scarcely went beyond the truth in any specific instance. The
tremendous significance lies in what we dared not tell; what I would not tell now
but for the need of warning others off from nameless terrors.

It is a fact that the wind had brought dreadful havoc. Whether all could have
lived through it, even without the other thing, is gravely open to doubt. The
storm, with its fury of madly driven ice particles, must have been beyond
anything our expedition had encountered before. One aeroplane shelter-wall, it
seems, had been left in a far too flimsy and inadequate state - was nearly
pulverized - and the derrick at the distant boring was entirely shaken to pieces.
The exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was bruised
into a high polish, and two of the small tents were flattened despite their snow
banking. Wooden surfaces left out in the blaster were pitted and denuded of
paint, and all signs of tracks in the snow were completely obliterated. It is also
true that we found none of the Archaean biological objects in a condition to take
outside as a whole. We did gather some minerals from a vast, tumbled pile,
including several of the greenish soapstone fragments whose odd five-pointed
rounding and faint patterns of grouped dots caused so many doubtful
comparisons; and some fossil bones, among which were the most typical of the
curiously injured specimens.

None of the dogs survived, their hurriedly built snow inclosure near the camp
being almost wholly destroyed. The wind may have done that, though the
greater breakage on the side next the camp, which was not the windward one,
suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic beasts themselves. All three
sledges were gone, and we have tried to explain that the wind may have blown
them off into the unknown. The drill and ice-melting machinery at the boring
were too badly damaged to warrant salvage, so we used them to choke up that
subtly disturbing gateway to the past which Lake had blasted. We likewise left at
the camp the two most shaken up of the planes; since our surviving party had
only four real pilots - Sherman, Danforth, McTighe, and Ropes - in all, with
Danforth in a poor nervous shape to navigate. We brought back all the books,
scientific equipment, and other incidentals we could find, though much was
rather unaccountably blown away. Spare tents and furs were either missing or
badly out of condition.

It was approximately 4 P.M., after wide plane cruising had forced us to give
Gedney up for lost, that we sent our guarded message to the Arkham for
relaying; and I think we did well to keep it as calm and noncommittal as we
succeeded in doing. The most we said about agitation concerned our dogs,
whose frantic uneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from
poor Lake's accounts. We did not mention, I think, their display of the same



uneasiness when sniffing around the queer greenish soapstones and certain other
objects in the disordered region-objects including scientific instruments,
aeroplanes, and machinery, both at the camp and at the boring, whose parts had
been loosened, moved, or otherwise tampered with by winds that must have
harbored singular curiosity and investigativeness.

About the fourteen biological specimens, we were pardonably indefinite. We
said that the only ones we discovered were damaged, but that enough was left of
them to prove Lake's description wholly and impressively accurate. It was hard
work keeping our personal emotions out of this matter - and we did not mention
numbers or say exactly how we had found those which we did find. We had by
that time agreed not to transmit anything suggesting madness on the part of
Lake's men, and it surely looked like madness to find six imperfect monstrosities
carefully buried upright in nine-foot snow graves under five-pointed mounds
punched over with groups of dots in patterns exactly those on the queer greenish
soapstones dug up from Mesozoic or Tertiary times. The eight perfect specimens
mentioned by Lake seemed to have been completely blown away.

We were careful, too, about the public's general peace of mind; hence Danforth
and I said little about that frightful trip over the mountains the next day. It was
the fact that only a radically lightened plane could possibly cross a range of such
height, which mercifully limited that scouting tour to the two of us. On our
return at one A.M., Danforth was close to hysterics, but kept an admirably stiff
upper lip. It took no persuasion to make him promise not to show our sketches
and the other things we brought away in our pockets, not to say anything more
to the others than what we had agreed to relay outside, and to hide our camera
films for private development later on; so that part of my present story will be as
new to Pabodie, McTighe, Ropes, Sherman, and the rest as it will be to the world
in general. Indeed, Danforth is closer mouthed than I: for he saw, or thinks he
saw, one thing he will not tell even me.

As all know, our report included a tale of a hard ascent - a confirmation of Lake's
opinion that the great peaks are of Archaean slate and other very primal
crumpled strata unchanged since at least middle Comanchian times; a
conventional comment on the regularity of the clinging cube and rampart
formations; a decision that the cave mouths indicate dissolved calcaerous veins; a
conjecture that certain slopes and passes would permit of the scaling and
crossing of the entire range by seasoned mountaineers; and a remark that the
mysterious other side holds a lofty and immense superplateau as ancient and
unchanging as the mountains themselves - twenty thousand feet in elevation,
with grotesque rock formations protruding through a thin glacial layer and with
low gradual foothills between the general plateau surface and the sheer
precipices of the highest peaks.


This body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes, and it completely
satisfied the men at the camp. We laid our absence of sixteen hours - a longer
time than our announced flying, landing, reconnoitering, and rock-collecting
program called for - to a long mythical spell of adverse wind conditions, and told
truly of our landing on the farther foothills. Fortunately our tale sounded
realistic and prosaic enough not to tempt any of the others into emulating our
flight. Had any tried to do that, I would have used every ounce of my persuasion
to stop them - and I do not know what Danforth would have done. While we
were gone, Pabodie, Sherman, Ropes, McTighe, and Williamson had worked like
beavers over Lake's two best planes, fitting them again for use despite the
altogether unaccountable juggling of their operative mechanism.

We decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for our old
base as soon as possible. Even though indirect, that was the safest way to work
toward McMurdo Sound; for a straightline flight across the most utterly
unknown stretches of the aeon-dead continent would involve many additional
hazards. Further exploration was hardly feasible in view of our tragic decimation
and the ruin of our drilling machinery. The doubts and horrors around us -
which we did not reveal - made us wish only to escape from this austral world of
desolation and brooding madness as swiftly as we could.

As the public knows, our return to the world was accomplished without further
disasters. All planes reached the old base on the evening of the next day -
January 27th - after a swift nonstop flight; and on the 28th we made McMurdo
Sound in two laps, the one pause being very brief, and occasioned by a faulty
rudder in the furious wind over the ice shelf after we had cleared the great
plateau. In five days more, the Arkham and Miskatonic, with all hands and
equipment on board, were shaking clear of the thickening field ice and working
up Ross Sea with the mocking mountains of Victoria Land looming westward
against a troubled antarctic sky and twisting the wind's wails into a wide-ranged
musical piping which chilled my soul to the quick. Less than a fortnight later we
left the last hint of polar land behind us and thanked heaven that we were clear
of a haunted, accursed realm where life and death, space and time, have made
black and blasphemous alliances, in the unknown epochs since matter first
writhed and swam on the planet's scarce-cooled crust.

Since our return we have all constantly worked to discourage antarctic
exploration, and have kept certain doubts and guesses to ourselves with
splendid unity and faithfulness. Even young Danforth, with his nervous
breakdown, has not flinched or babbled to his doctors - indeed, as I have said,
there is one thing he thinks he alone saw which he will not tell even me, though I
think it would help his psychological state if he would consent to do so. It might
explain and relieve much, though perhaps the thing was no more than the



delusive aftermath of an earlier shock. That is the impression I gather after those
rare, irresponsible moments when he whispers disjointed things to me - things
which he repudiates vehemently as soon as he gets a grip on himself again.

It will be hard work deterring others from the great white south, and some of our
efforts may directly harm our cause by drawing inquiring notice. We might have
known from the first that human curiosity is undying, and that the results we
announced would be enough to spur others ahead on the same age-long pursuit
of the unknown. Lake's reports of those biological monstrosities had aroused
naturalists and paleontologists to the highest pitch, though we were sensible
enough not to show the detached parts we had taken from the actual buried
specimens, or our photographs of those specimens as they were found. We also
refrained from showing the more puzzling of the scarred bones and greenish
soapstones; while Danforth and I have closely guarded the pictures we took or
drew on the superplateau across the range, and the crumpled things we
smoothed, studied in terror, and brought away in our pockets.

But now that Starkweather-Moore party is organizing, and with a thoroughness
far beyond anything our outfit attempted. If not dissuaded, they will get to the
innermost nucleus of the antarctic and melt and bore till they bring up that
which we know may end the world. So I must break through all reticences at last
- even about that ultimate, nameless thing beyond the mountains of madness.

IV

It is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that I let my mind go back to
Lake's camp and what we really found there - and to that other thing beyond the
mountains of madness. I am constantly tempted to shirk the details, and to let
hints stand for actual facts and ineluctable deductions. I hope I have said enough
already to let me glide briefly over the rest; the rest, that is, of the horror at the
camp. I have told of the wind-ravaged terrain, the damaged shelters, the
disarranged machinery, the varied uneasiness of our dogs, the missing sledges
and other items, the deaths of men and dogs, the absence of Gedney, and the six
insanely buried biological specimens, strangely sound in texture for all their
structural injuries, from a world forty million years dead. I do not recall whether
I mentioned that upon checking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing.
We did not think much about that till later - indeed, only Danforth and I have
thought of it at all.

The principal things I have been keeping back relate to the bodies, and to certain
subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and incredible kind of
rationale to the apparent chaos. At the time, I tried to keep the men's minds off
those points; for it was so much simpler - so much more normal - to lay


everything to an outbreak of madness on the part of some of Lake's party. From
the look of things, that demon mountain wind must have been enough to drive
any man mad in the midst of this center of all earthly mystery and desolation.

The crowning abnormality, of course, was the condition of the bodies - men and
dogs alike. They had all been in some terrible kind of conflict, and were torn and
mangled in fiendish and altogether inexplicable ways. Death, so far as we could
judge, had in each case come from strangulation or laceration. The dogs had
evidently started the trouble, for the state of their ill-built corral bore witness to
its forcible breakage from within. It had been set some distance from the camp
because of the hatred of the animals for those hellish Archaean organisms, but
the precaution seemed to have been taken in vain. When left alone in that
monstrous wind, behind flimsy walls of insufficient height, they must have
stampeded - whether from the wind itself, or from some subtle, increasing odor
emitted by the nightmare specimens, one could not say.

But whatever had happened, it was hideous and revolting enough. Perhaps I had
better put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at last - though with a
categorical statement of opinion, based on the first-hand observations and most
rigid deductions of both Danforth and myself, that the then missing Gedney was
in no way responsible for the loathsome horrors we found. I have said that the
bodies were frightfully mangled. Now I must add that some were incised and
subtracted from in the most curious, cold-blooded, and inhuman fashion. It was
the same with dogs and men. All the healthier, fatter bodies, quadrupedal or
bipedal, had had their most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed, as by a
careful butcher; and around them was a strange sprinkling of salt - taken from
the ravaged provision chests on the planes - which conjured up the most horrible
associations. The thing had occurred in one of the crude aeroplane shelters from
which the plane had been dragged out, and subsequent winds had effaced all
tracks which could have supplied any plausible theory. Scattered bits of clothing,
roughly slashed from the human incision subjects, hinted no clues. It is useless to
bring up the half impression of certain faint snow prints in one shielded corner of
the ruined inclosure - because that impression did not concern human prints at
all, but was clearly mixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor Lake
had been giving throughout the preceding weeks. One had to be careful of one's
imagination in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madness.

As I have indicated, Gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in the end.
When we came on that terrible shelter we had missed two dogs and two men;
but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent, which we entered after investigating the
monstrous graves, had something to reveal. It was not as Lake had left it, for the
covered parts of the primal monstrosity had been removed from the improvised
table. Indeed, we had already realized that one of the six imperfect and insanely



buried things we had found - the one with the trace of a pecuharly hateful odor -
must represent the collected sections of the entity which Lake had tried to
analyze. On and around that laboratory table were strewn other things, and it
did not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully though
oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog. I shall spare the
feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the man's identity. Lake's
anatomical instruments were missing, but there were evidences of their careful
cleansing. The gasoline stove was also gone, though around it we found a
curious litter of matches. We buried the human parts beside the other ten men;
and the canine parts with the other thirty-five dogs. Concerning the bizarre
smudges on the laboratory table, and on the jumble of roughly handled
illustrated books scattered near it, we were much too bewildered to speculate.

This formed the worst of the camp horror, but other things were equally
perplexing. The disappearance of Gedney, the one dog, the eight uninjured
biological specimens, the three sledges, and certain instruments, illustrated
technical and scientific books, writing materials, electric torches and batteries,
food and fuel, heating apparatus, spare tents, fur suits, and the like, was utterly
beyond sane conjecture; as were likewise the spatter-fringed ink blots on certain
pieces of paper, and the evidences of curious alien fumbling and experimentation
around the planes and all other mechanical devices both at the camp and at the
boring.

The dogs seemed to abhor this oddly disordered machinery. Then, too, there was
the upsetting of the larder, the disappearance of certain staples, and the jarringly
comical heap of tin cans pried open in the most unlikely ways and at the most
unlikely places. The profusion of scattered matches, intact, broken, or spent,
formed another minor enigma - as did the two or three tent cloths and fur suits
which we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings conceivably
due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations. The maltreatment of the
human and canine bodies, and the crazy burial of the damaged Archaean
specimens, were all of a piece with this apparent disintegrative madness. In view
of just such an eventuality as the present one, we carefully photographed all the
main evidences of insane disorder at the camp; and shall use the prints to
buttress our pleas against the departure of the proposed Starkweather- Moore
Expedition.

Our first act after finding the bodies in the shelter was to photograph and open
the row of insane graves with the five-pointed snow mounds. We could not help
noticing the resemblance of these monstrous mounds, with their clusters of
grouped dots, to poor Lake's descriptions of the strange greenish soapstones;
and when we came on some of the soapstones themselves in the great mineral
pile, we found the likeness very close indeed. The whole general formation, it



must be made clear, seemed abominably suggestive of the starfish head of the
Archaean entities; and we agreed that the suggestion must have worked potently
upon the sensitized minds of Lake's overwrought party.

For madness - centering in Gedney as the only possible surviving agent - was the
explanation spontaneously adopted by everybody so far as spoken utterance was
concerned; though I will not be so naive as to deny that each of us may have
harbored wild guesses which sanity forbade him to formulate completely.
Sherman, Pabodie, and McTighe made an exhaustive aeroplane cruise over all
the surrounding territory in the afternoon, sweeping the horizon with field
glasses in quest of Gedney and of the various missing things; but nothing came
to light. The party reported that the titan barrier range extended endlessly to
right and left alike, without any diminution in height or essential structure. On
some of the peaks, though, the regular cube and rampart formations were bolder
and plainer, having doubly fantastic similitudes to Roerich-painted Asian hill
ruins. The distribution of cryptical cave mouths on the black snow-denuded
summits seemed roughly even as far as the range could be traced.

In spite of all the prevailing horrors, we were left with enough sheer scientific
zeal and adventurousness to wonder about the unknown realm beyond those
mysterious mountains. As our guarded messages stated, we rested at midnight
after our day of terror and bafflement - but not without a tentative plan for one
or more range-crossing altitude flights in a lightened plane with aerial camera
and geologist's outfit, beginning the following morning. It was decided that
Danforth and I try it first, and we awaked at 7 A.M. intending an early flight;
however, heavy winds - mentioned in our brief, bulletin to the outside world -
delayed our start till nearly nine o'clock.

I have already repeated the noncommittal story we told the men at camp - and
relayed outside - after our return sixteen hours later. It is now my terrible duty to
amplify this account by filling in the merciful blanks with hints of what we really
saw in the hidden transmontane world - hints of the revelations which have
finally driven Danforth to a nervous collapse. I wish he would add a really frank
word about the thing which he thinks he alone saw - even though it was
probably a nervous delusion - and which was perhaps the last straw that put him
where he is; but he is firm against that. All I can do is to repeat his later
disjointed whispers about what set him shrieking as the plane soared back
through the wind-tortured mountain pass after that real and tangible shock
which I shared. This will form my last word. If the plain signs of surviving elder
horrors in what I disclose be not enough to keep others from meddling with the
inner antarctic - or at least from prying too deeply beneath the surface of that
ultimate waste of forbidden secrets and inhuman, aeon-cursed desolation - the
responsibility for unnamable and perhaps immeasurable evils will not be mine.



Danforth and I, studying the notes made by Pabodie in his afternoon flight and
checking up with a sextant, had calculated that the lowest available pass in the
range lay somewhat to the right of us, within sight of camp, and about twenty-
three thousand or twenty-four thousand feet above sea level. For this point, then,
we first headed in the lightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery.
The camp itself, on foothills which sprang from a high continental plateau, was
some twelve thousand feet in altitude; hence the actual height increase necessary
was not so vast as it might seem. Nevertheless we were acutely conscious of the
rarefied air and intense cold as we rose; for, on account of visibility conditions,
we had to leave the cabin windows open. We were dressed, of course, in our
heaviest furs.

As we drew near the forbidding peaks, dark and sinister above the line of
crevasse-riven snow and interstitial glaciers, we noticed more and more the
curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes; and thought again of the
strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich. The ancient and wind-weathered
rock strata fully verified all of Lake's bulletins, and proved that these pinnacles
had been towering up in exactly the same way since a surprisingly early time in
earth's history - perhaps over fifty million years. How much higher they had
once been, it was futile to guess; but everything about this strange region pointed
to obscure atmospheric influences unfavorable to change, and calculated to
retard the usual climatic processes of rock disintegration.

But it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes, ramparts, and cave mouths
which fascinated and disturbed us most. I studied them with a field glass and
took aerial photographs while Danforth drove; and at times I relieved him at the
controls - though my aviation knowledge was purely an amateur's - in order to
let him use the binoculars. We could easily see that much of the material of the
things was a lightish Archaean quartzite, unlike any formation visible over broad
areas of the general surface; and that their regularity was extreme and uncanny
to an extent which poor Lake had scarcely hinted.

As he had said, their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold aeons of
savage weathering; but their preternatural solidity and tough material had saved
them from obliteration. Many parts, especially those closest to the slopes, seemed
identical in substance with the surrounding rock surface. The whole arrangement
looked like the ruins of Macchu Picchu in the Andes, or the primal foundation
walls of Kish as dug up by the Oxford Field Museum Expedition in 1929; and
both Danforth and I obtained that occasional impression of separate Cyclopean
blocks which Lake had attributed to his flight-companion Carroll. How to
account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me, and I felt queerly
humbled as a geologist. Igneous formations often have strange regularities - like
the famous Giants' Causeway in Ireland - but this stupendous range, despite


Lake's original suspicion of smoking cones, was above all else nonvolcanic in
evident structure.

The curious cave mouths, near which the odd formations seemed most
abundant, presented another albeit a lesser puzzle because of their regularity of
outline. They were, as Lake's bulletin had said, often approximately square or
semicircular; as if the natural orifices had been shaped to greater symmetry by
some magic hand. Their numerousness and wide distribution were remarkable,
and suggested that the whole region was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved
out of limestone strata. Such glimpses as we secured did not extend far within
the caverns, but we saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and
stalagmites. Outside, those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures
seemed invariably smooth and regular; and Danforth thought that the slight
cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual patterns. Filled as
he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the camp, he hinted that
the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling groups of dots sprinkled over the
primeval greenish soapstones, so hideously duplicated on the madly conceived
snow mounds above those six buried monstrosities.

We had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along toward the
relatively low pass we had selected. As we advanced we occasionally looked
down at the snow and ice of the land route, wondering whether we could have
attempted the trip with the simpler equipment of earlier days. Somewhat to our
surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult as such things go; and that
despite the crevasses and other bad spots it would not have been likely to deter
the sledges of a Scott, a Shackleton, or an Amundsen. Some of the glaciers
appeared to lead up to wind-bared passes with unusual continuity, and upon
reaching our chosen pass we found that its case formed no exception.

Our sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest and peer
out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper; even though we
had no cause to think the regions beyond the range essentially different from
those already seen and traversed. The touch of evil mystery in these barrier
mountains, and in the beckoning sea of opalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their
summits, was a highly subtle and attenuated matter not to be explained in literal
words. Rather was it an affair of vague psychological symbolism and aesthetic
association - a thing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings, and with archaic
myths lurking in shunned and forbidden volumes. Even the wind's burden held
a peculiar strain of conscious malignity; and for a second it seemed that the
composite sound included a bizarre musical whistling or piping over a wide
range as the blast swept in and out of the omnipresent and resonant cave
mouths. There was a cloudy note of reminiscent repulsion in this sound, as
complex and unplaceable as any of the other dark impressions.


We were now, after a slow ascent, at a height of twenty-three thousand, five
hundred and seventy feet according to the aneroid; and had left the region of
clinging snow definitely below us. Up here were only dark, bare rock slopes and
the start of rough-ribbed glaciers - but with those provocative cubes, ramparts,
and echoing cave mouths to add a portent of the unnatural, the fantastic, and the
dreamlike. Looking along the line of high peaks, I thought I could see the one
mentioned by poor Lake, with a rampart exactly on top. It seemed to be half lost
in a queer antarctic haze - such a haze, perhaps, as had been responsible for
Lake's early notion of volcanism. The pass loomed directly before us, smooth
and windswept between its jagged and malignly frowning pylons. Beyond it was
a sky fretted with swirling vapors and lighted by the low polar sun - the sky of
that mysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazed.

A few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm. Danforth and I,
unable to speak except in shouts amidst the howling, piping wind that raced
through the pass and added to the noise of the unmuffled engines, exchanged
eloquent glances. And then, having gained those last few feet, we did indeed
stare across the momentous divide and over the unsampled secrets of an elder
and utterly alien earth.

V

I think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe, wonder, terror,
and disbelief in our own senses as we finally cleared the pass and saw what lay
beyond. Of course, we must have had some natural theory in the back of our
heads to steady our faculties for the moment. Probably we thought of such things
as the grotesquely weathered stones of the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, or
the fantastically symmetrical wind-carved rocks of the Arizona desert. Perhaps
we even half thought the sight a mirage like that we had seen the morning before
on first approaching those mountains of madness. We must have had some such
normal notions to fall back upon as our eyes swept that limitless, tempest-
scarred plateau and grasped the almost endless labyrinth of colossal, regular,
and geometrically eurythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and
pitted crests above a glacial sheet not more than forty or fifty feet deep at its
thickest, and in places obviously thinner.

The effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable, for some fiendish violation
of known natural law seemed certain at the outset. Here, on a hellishly ancient
table-land fully twenty thousand feet high, and in a climate deadly to habitation
since a prehuman age not less than five hundred thousand years ago, there
stretched nearly to the vision's limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the
desperation of mental self- defense could possibly attribute to any but conscious
and artificial cause. We had previously dismissed, so far as serious thought was


concerned, any theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were
other than natural in origin. How could they be otherwise, when man himself
could scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time when this
region succumbed to the present unbroken reign of glacial death?

Yet now the sway of reason seemed irrefutably shaken, for this Cyclopean maze
of squared, curved, and angled blocks had features which cut off all comfortable
refuge. It was, very clearly, the blasphemous city of the mirage in stark, objective,
and ineluctable reality. That damnable portent had had a material basis after all -
there had been some horizontal stratum of ice dust in the upper air, and this
shocking stone survival had projected its image across the mountains according
to the simple laws of reflection. Of course, the phantom had been twisted and
exaggerated, and had contained things which the real source did not contain; yet
now, as we saw that real source, we thought it even more hideous and menacing
than its distant image.

Only the incredible, unhuman massiveness of these vast stone towers and
ramparts had saved the frightful things from utter annihilation in the hundreds
of thousands - perhaps millions - of years it had brooded there amidst the blasts
of a bleak upland. "Corona Mundi - Roof of the World - " All sorts of fantastic
phrases sprang to our lips as we looked dizzily down at the unbelievable
spectacle. I thought again of the eldritch primal myths that had so persistently
haunted me since my first sight of this dead antarctic world - of the demoniac
plateau of Leng, of the Mi-Go, or abominable Snow Men of the Himalayas, of the
Pnakotic Manuscripts with their prehuman implications, of the Cthulhu cult, of
the Necronomicon, and of the Hyperborean legends of formless Tsathoggua and
the worse than formless star spawn associated with that semientity.

For boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with very little
thinning; indeed, as our eyes followed it to the right and left along the base of the
low, gradual foothills which separated it from the actual mountain rim, we
decided that we could see no thinning at all except for an interruption at the left
of the pass through which we had come. We had merely struck, at random, a
limited part of something of incalculable extent. The foothills were more sparsely
sprinkled with grotesque stone structures, linking the terrible city to the already
familiar cubes and ramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts.
These latter, as well as the queer cave mouths, were as thick on the inner as on
the outer sides of the mountains.

The nameless stone labyrinth consisted, for the most part, of walls from ten to
one hundred and fifty feet in ice-clear height, and of a thickness varying from
five to ten feet. It was composed mostly of prodigious blocks of dark primordial
slate, schist, and sandstone - blocks in many cases as large as 4 x 6 x 8 feet -


though in several places it seemed to be carved out of a solid, uneven bed rock of
pre-Cambrian slate. The buildings were far from equal in size, there being
innumerable honeycomb arrangements of enormous extent as well as smaller
separate structures. The general shape of these things tended to be conical,
pyramidal, or terraced; though there were many perfect cylinders, perfect cubes,
clusters of cubes, and other rectangular forms, and a peculiar sprinkling of
angled edifices whose five-pointed ground plan roughly suggested modern
fortifications. The builders had made constant and expert use of the principle of
the arch, and domes had probably existed in the city's heyday.

The whole tangle was monstrously weathered, and the glacial surface from
which the towers projected was strewn with fallen blocks and immemorial
debris. Where the glaciation was transparent we could see the lower parts of the
gigantic piles, and we noticed the ice-preserved stone bridges which connected
the different towers at varying distances above the ground. On the exposed walls
we could detect the scarred places where other and higher bridges of the same
sort had existed. Closer inspection revealed countless largish windows; some of
which were closed with shutters of a petrified material originally wood, though
most gaped open in a sinister and menacing fashion. Many of the ruins, of
course, were roofless, and with uneven though wind-rounded upper edges;
whilst others, of a more sharply conical or pyramidal model or else protected by
higher surrounding structures, preserved intact outlines despite the omnipresent
crumbling and pitting. With the field glass we could barely make out what
seemed to be sculptural decorations in horizontal bands - decorations including
those curious groups of dots whose presence on the ancient soapstones now
assumed a vastly larger significance.

In many places the buildings were totally ruined and the ice sheet deeply riven
from various geologic causes. In other places the stonework was worn down to
the very level of the glaciation. One broad swath, extending from the plateau's
interior, to a cleft in the foothills about a mile to the left of the pass we had
traversed, was wholly free from buildings. It probably represented, we
concluded, the course of some great river which in Tertiary times - millions of
years ago - had poured through the city and into some prodigious subterranean
abyss of the great barrier range. Certainly, this was above all a region of caves,
gulfs, and underground secrets beyond human penetration.

Looking back to our sensations, and recalling our dazedness at viewing this
monstrous survival from aeons we had thought prehuman, I can only wonder
that we preserved the semblance of equilibrium, which we did. Of course, we
knew that something - chronology, scientific theory, or our own consciousness -
was woefully awry; yet we kept enough poise to guide the plane, observe many
things quite minutely, and take a careful series of photographs which may yet


serve both us and the world in good stead. In my case, ingrained scientific habit
may have helped; for above all my bewilderment and sense of menace, there
burned a dominant curiosity to fathom more of this age-old secret - to know
what sort of beings had built and lived in this incalculably gigantic place, and
what relation to the general world of its time or of other times so unique a
concentration of life could have had.

For this place could be no ordinary city. It must have formed the primary
nucleus and center of some archaic and unbelievable chapter of earth's history
whose outward ramifications, recalled only dimly in the most obscure and
distorted myths, had vanished utterly amidst the chaos of terrene convulsions
long before any human race we know had shambled out of apedom. Here
sprawled a Palaeogaean megalopolis compared with which the fabled Atlantis
and Lemuria, Commoriom and Uzuldaroum, and Olathoc in the land of Lomar,
are recent things of today - not even of yesterday; a megalopolis ranking with
such whispered prehuman blasphemies as Valusia, R'lyeh, lb in the land of
Mnar, and the Nameless city of Arabia Deserta. As we flew above that tangle of
stark titan towers my imagination sometimes escaped all bounds and roved
aimlessly in realms of fantastic associations - even weaving links betwixt this lost
world and some of my own wildest dreams concerning the mad horror at the
camp.

The plane's fuel tank, in the interest of greater lightness, had been only partly
filled; hence we now had to exert caution in our explorations. Even so, however,
we covered an enormous extent of ground - or, rather, air - after swooping down
to a level where the wind became virtually negligible. There seemed to be no
limit to the mountain range, or to the length of the frightful stone city which
bordered its inner foothills. Fifty miles of flight in each direction showed no
major change in the labyrinth of rock and masonry that clawed up corpselike
through the eternal ice. There were, though, some highly absorbing
diversifications; such as the carvings on the canyon where that broad river had
once pierced the foothills and approached its sinking place in the great range.
The headlands at the stream's entrance had been boldly carved into Cyclopean
pylons; and something about the ridgy, barrel-shaped designs stirred up oddly
vague, hateful, and confusing semi-remembrances in both Danforth and me.

We also came upon several star-shaped open spaces, evidently public squares,
and noted various undulations in the terrain. Where a sharp hill rose, it was
generally hollowed out into some sort of rambling-stone edifice; but there were
at least two exceptions. Of these latter, one was too badly weathered to disclose
what had been on the jutting eminence, while the other still bore a fantastic
conical monument carved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such
things as the well-known Snake Tomb in the ancient valley of Petra.


Flying inland from the mountains, we discovered that the city was not of infinite
width, even though its length along the foothills seemed endless. After about
thirty miles the grotesque stone buildings began to thin out, and in ten more
miles we came to an unbroken waste virtually without signs of sentient artifice.
The course of the river beyond the city seemed marked by a broad, depressed
line, while the land assumed a somewhat greater ruggedness, seeming to slope
slightly upward as it receded in the mist-hazed west.

So far we had made no landing, yet to leave the plateau without an attempt at
entering some of the monstrous structures would have been inconceivable.
Accordingly, we decided to find a smooth place on the foothills near our
navigable pass, there grounding the plane and preparing to do some exploration
on foot. Though these gradual slopes were partly covered with a scattering of
ruins, low flying soon disclosed an ampler number of possible landing places.
Selecting that nearest to the pass, since our flight would be across the great range
and back to camp, we succeeded about 12:30 P.M. in effecting a landing on a
smooth, hard snow field wholly devoid of obstacles and well adapted to a swift
and favorable take- off later on.

It did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for so brief a
time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this level; hence we
merely saw that the landing skis were safely lodged, and that the vital parts of
the mechanism were guarded against the cold. For our foot journey we discarded
the heaviest of our flying furs, and took with us a small outfit consisting of
pocket compass, hand camera, light provisions, voluminous notebooks and
paper, geologist's hammer and chisel, specimen bags, coil of climbing rope, and
powerful electric torches with extra batteries; this equipment having been carried
in the plane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing, take ground
pictures, make drawings and topographical sketches, and obtain rock specimens
from some bare slope, outcropping, or mountain cave. Fortunately we had a
supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a spare specimen bag, and use on the
ancient principle of hare and hounds for marking our course in any interior
mazes we might be able to penetrate. This had been brought in case we found
some cave system with air quiet enough to allow such a rapid and easy method
in place of the usual rock-chipping method of trail blazing.

Walking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow toward the stupendous
stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west, we felt almost as keen a
sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on approaching the unfathomed
mountain pass four hours previously. True, we had become visually familiar
with the incredible secret concealed by the barrier peaks; yet the prospect of
actually entering primordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions
of years ago - before any known race of men could have existed - was none the


less awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic abnormality.
Though the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made exertion
somewhat more difficult than usual, both Danforth and I found ourselves
bearing up very well, and felt equal to almost any task which might fall to our
lot. It took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level with the
snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge, roofless rampart still
complete in its gigantic five-pointed outline and rising to an irregular height of
ten or eleven feet. For this latter we headed; and when at last we were actually
able to touch its weathered Cyclopean blocks, we felt that we had established an
unprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten aeons normally
closed to our species.

This rampart, shaped like a star and perhaps three hundred feet from point to
point, was built of Jurassic sandstone blocks of irregular size, averaging 6x8 feet
in surface. There was a row of arched loopholes or windows about four feet wide
and five feet high, spaced quite symmetrically along the points of the star and at
its inner angles, and with the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface.
Looking through these, we could see that the masonry was fully five feet thick,
that there were no partitions remaining within, and that there were traces of
banded carvings or bas-reliefs on the interior walls - facts we had indeed guessed
before, when flying low over this rampart and others like it. Though lower parts
must have originally existed, all traces of such things were now wholly obscured
by the deep layer of ice and snow at this point.

We crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher the nearly
effaced mural designs, but did not attempt to disturb the glaciated floor. Our
orientation flights had indicated that many buildings in the city proper were less
ice-choked, and that we might perhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down
to the true ground level if we entered those structures still roofed at the top.
Before we left the rampart we photographed it carefully, and studied its mortar-
less Cyclopean masonry with complete bewilderment. We wished that Pabodie
were present, for his engineering knowledge might have helped us guess how
such titanic blocks could have been handled in that unbelievably remote age
when the city and its outskirts were built up.

The half-mile walk downhill to the actual city, with the upper wind shrieking
vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the background, was
something of which the smallest details will always remain engraved on my
mind. Only in fantastic nightmares could any human beings but Danforth and
me conceive such optical effects. Between us and the churning vapors of the west
lay that monstrous tangle of dark stone towers, its outre and incredible forms
impressing us afresh at every new angle of vision. It was a mirage in solid stone,
and were it not for the photographs, I would still doubt that such a thing could


be. The general type of masonry was identical with that of the rampart we had
examined; but the extravagant shapes which this masonry took in its urban
manifestations were past all description.

Even the pictures illustrate only one or two phases of its endless variety,
preternatural massiveness, and utterly alien exoticism. There were geometrical
forms for which an Euclid would scarcely find a name - cones of all degrees of
irregularity and truncation, terraces of every sort of provocative disproportion,
shafts with odd bulbous enlargements, broken columns in curious groups, and
five-pointed or five-ridged arrangements of mad grotesqueness. As we drew
nearer we could see beneath certain transparent parts of the ice sheet, and detect
some of the tubular stone bridges that connected the crazily sprinkled structures
at various heights. Of orderly streets there seemed to be none, the only broad
open swath being a mile to the left, where the ancient river had doubtless flowed
through the town into the mountains.

Our field glasses showed the external, horizontal bands of nearly effaced
sculptures and dot groups to be very prevalent, and we could half imagine what
the city must once have looked like - even though most of the roofs and tower
tops had necessarily perished. As a whole, it had been a complex tangle of
twisted lanes and alleys, all of them deep canyons, and some little better than
tunnels because of the overhanging masonry or overarching bridges. Now,
outspread below us, it loomed like a dream fantasy against a westward mist
through whose northern end the low, reddish antarctic sun of early afternoon
was struggling to shine; and when, for a moment, that sun encountered a denser
obstruction and plunged the scene into temporary shadow, the effect was subtly
menacing in a way I can never hope to depict. Even the faint howling and piping
of the unfelt wind in the great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder note
of purposeful malignity. The last stage of our descent to the town was unusually
steep and abrupt, and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed
led us to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there. Under the
glaciation, we believed, there must be a flight of steps or its equivalent.

When at last we plunged into the town itself, clambering over fallen masonry
and shrinking from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height of omnipresent
crumbling and pitted walls, our sensations again became such that I marvel at
the amount of self-control we retained. Danforth was frankly jumpy, and began
making some offensively irrelevant speculations about the horror at the camp -
which I resented all the more because I could not help sharing certain
conclusions forced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from
nightmare antiquity. The speculations worked on his imagination, too; for in one
place - where a debris-littered alley turned a sharp corner - he insisted that he
saw faint traces of ground markings which he did not like; whilst elsewhere he


stopped to listen to a subtle, imaginary sound from some undefined point - a
muffled musical piping, he said, not unlike that of the wind in the mountain
caves, yet somehow disturbingly different. The ceaseless five-pointedness of the
surrounding architecture and of the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a
dimly sinister suggestiveness we could not escape, and gave us a touch of
terrible subconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared
and dwelt in this unhallowed place.

Nevertheless, our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly dead, and
we mechanically carried out our program of chipping specimens from all the
different rock types represented in the masonry. We wished a rather full set in
order to draw better conclusions regarding the age of the place. Nothing in the
great outer walls seemed to date from later than the Jurassic and Comanchian
periods, nor was any piece of stone in the entire place of a greater recency than
the Pliocene Age. In stark certainty, we were wandering amidst a death which
had reigned at least five hundred thousand years, and in all probability even
longer.

As we proceeded through this maze of stone-shadowed twilight we stopped at
all available apertures to study interiors and investigate entrance possibilities.
Some were above our reach, whilst others led only into ice-choked ruins as
unroofed and barren as the rampart on the hill. One, though spacious and
inviting, opened on a seemingly bottomless abyss without visible means of
descent. Now and then we had a chance to study the petrified wood of a
surviving shutter, and were impressed by the fabulous antiquity implied in the
still discernible grain. These things had come from Mesozoic gymnosperms and
conifers - especially Cretaceous cycads - and from fan palms and early
angiosperms of plainly Tertiary date. Nothing definitely later than the Pliocene
could be discovered. In the placing of these shutters - whose edges showed the
former presence of queer and long-vanished hinges - usage seemed to be varied -
some being on the outer and some on the inner side of the deep embrasures.
They seemed to have become wedged in place, thus surviving the rusting of their
former and probably metallic fixtures and fastenings.

After a time we came across a row of windows - in the bulges of a colossal five-
edged cone of undamaged apex - which led into a vast, well-preserved room
with stone flooring; but these were too high in the room to permit descent
without a rope. We had a rope with us, but did not wish to bother with this
twenty-foot drop unless obliged to-especially in this thin plateau air where great
demands were made upon the heart action. This enormous room was probably a
hall or concourse of some sort, and our electric torches showed bold, distinct,
and potentially startling sculptures arranged round the walls in broad,
horizontal bands separated by equally broad strips of conventional arabesques.


We took careful note of this spot, planning to enter here unless a more easily
gained interior were encountered.

Finally, though, we did encounter exactly the opening we wished; an archway
about six feet wide and ten feet high, marking the former end of an aerial bridge
which had spanned an alley about five feet above the present level of glaciation.
These archways, of course, were flush with upper-story floors, and in this case
one of the floors still existed. The building thus accessible was a series of
rectangular terraces on our left facing westward. That across the alley, where the
other archway yawned, was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with a
curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture. It was totally dark inside, and
the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable emptiness.

Heaped debris made the entrance to the vast left-hand building doubly easy, yet
for a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the long-wished chance.
For though we had penetrated into this tangle of archaic mystery, it required
fresh resolution to carry us actually inside a complete and surviving building of a
fabulous elder world whose nature was becoming more and more hideously
plain to us. In the end, however, we made the plunge, and scrambled up over the
rubble into the gaping embrasure. The floor beyond was of great slate slabs, and
seemed to form the outlet of a long, high corridor with sculptured walls.

Observing the many inner archways which led off from it, and realizing the
probable complexity of the nest of apartments within, we decided that we must
begin our system of hare-and-hound trail blazing. Hitherto our compasses,
together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountain range between the towers
in our rear, had been enough to prevent our losing our way; but from now on,
the artificial substitute would be necessary. Accordingly we reduced our extra
paper to shreds of suitable size, placed these in a bag to be carried by Danforth,
and prepared to use them as economically as safety would allow. This method
would probably gain us immunity from straying, since there did not appear to be
any strong air currents inside the primordial masonry. If such should develop, or
if our paper supply should give out, we could of course fall back on the more
secure though more tedious and retarding method of rock chipping.

Just how extensive a territory we had opened up, it was impossible to guess
without a trial. The close and frequent connection of the different buildings made
it likely that we might cross from one to another on bridges underneath the ice,
except where impeded by local collapses and geologic rifts, for very little
glaciation seemed to have entered the massive constructions. Almost all the areas
of transparent ice had revealed the submerged windows as tightly shuttered, as
if the town had been left in that uniform state until the glacial sheet came to
crystallize the lower part for all succeeding time. Indeed, one gained a curious


impression that this place had been dehberately closed and deserted in some
dim, bygone aeon, rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even
gradual decay. Had the coming of the ice been foreseen, and had a nameless
population left en masse to seek a less doomed abode? The precise physiographic
conditions attending the formation of the ice sheet at this point would have to
wait for later solution. It had not, very plainly, been a grinding drive. Perhaps
the pressure of accumulated snows had been responsible, and perhaps some
flood from the river, or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the
great range, had helped to create the special state now observable. Imagination
could conceive almost anything in connection with this place.

VI

It would be cumbrous to give a detailed, consecutive account of our wanderings
inside that cavernous, aeon-dead honeycomb of primal masonry - that
monstrous lair of elder secrets which now echoed for the first time, after
uncounted epochs, to the tread of human feet. This is especially true because so
much of the horrible drama and revelation came from a mere study of the
omnipresent mural carvings. Our flashlight photographs of those carvings will
do much toward proving the truth of what we are now disclosing, and it is
lamentable that we had not a larger film supply with us. As it was, we made
crude notebook sketches of certain salient features after all our films were used
up.

The building which we had entered was one of great size and elaborateness, and
gave us an impressive notion of the architecture of that nameless geologic past.
The inner partitions were less massive than the outer walls, but on the lower
levels were excellently preserved. Labyrinthine complexity, involving curiously
irregular difference in floor levels, characterized the entire arrangement; and we
should certainly have been lost at the very outset but for the trail of torn paper
left behind us. We decided to explore the more decrepit upper parts first of all,
hence climbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some one hundred feet, to
where the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to the
polar sky. Ascent was effected over the steep, transversely ribbed stone ramps or
inclined planes which everywhere served in lieu of stairs. The rooms we
encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions, ranging from five-
pointed stars to triangles and perfect cubes. It might be safe to say that their
general average was about 30 x 30 feet in floor area, and 20 feet in height, though
many larger apartments existed. After thoroughly examining the upper regions
and the glacial level, we descended, story by story, into the submerged part,
where indeed we soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected
chambers and passages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this
particular building. The Cyclopean massiveness and gigantism of everything


about us became curiously oppressive; and there was something vaguely but
deeply unhuman in all the contours, dimensions, proportions, decorations, and
constructional nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework. We soon
realized, from what the carvings revealed, that this monstrous city was many
million years old.

We cannot yet explain the engineering principles used in the anomalous
balancing and adjustment of the vast rock masses, though the function of the
arch was clearly much relied on. The rooms we visited were wholly bare of all
portable contents, a circumstance which sustained our belief in the city's
deliberate desertion. The prime decorative feature was the almost universal
system of mural sculpture, which tended to run in continuous horizontal bands
three feet wide and arranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with bands of
equal width given over to geometrical arabesques. There were exceptions to this
rule of arrangement, but its preponderance was overwhelming. Often, however,
a series of smooth car-touches containing oddly patterned groups of dots would
be sunk along one of the arabesque bands.

The technique, we soon saw, was mature, accomplished, and aesthetically
evolved to the highest degree of civilized mastery, though utterly alien in every
detail to any known art tradition of the human race. In delicacy of execution no
sculpture I have ever seen could approach it. The minutest details of elaborate
vegetation, or of animal life, were rendered with astonishing vividness despite
the bold scale of the carvings; whilst the conventional designs were marvels of
skillful intricacy. The arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical
principles, and were made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based
on the quantity of five. The pictorial bands followed a highly formalized
tradition, and involved a peculiar treatment of perspective, but had an artistic
force that moved us profoundly, notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast
geologic periods. Their method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of
the cross section with the two-dimensional silhouette, and embodied an
analytical psychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity. It is useless to
try to compare this art with any represented in our museums. Those who see our
photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain grotesque
conceptions of the most daring futurists.

The arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines, whose depth on
unweathered walls varied from one to two inches. When cartouches with dot
groups appeared - evidently as inscriptions in some unknown and primordial
language and alphabet - the depression of the smooth surface was perhaps an
inch and a half, and of the dots perhaps a half inch more. The pictorial bands
were in countersunk low relief, their background being depressed about two
inches from the original wall surface. In some specimens marks of a former


coloration could be detected, though for the most part the untold aeons had
disintegrated and banished any pigments which may have been applied. The
more one studied the marvelous technique, the more one admired the things.
Beneath their strict conventionalization one could grasp the minute and accurate
observation and graphic skill of the artists; and indeed, the very conventions
themselves served to symbolize and accentuate the real essence or vital
differentiation of every object delineated. We felt, too, that besides these
recognizable excellences there were others lurking beyond the reach of our
perceptions. Certain touches here and there gave vague hints of latent symbols
and stimuli which another mental and emotional background, and a fuller or
different sensory equipment, might have made of profound and poignant
significance to us.

The subject matter of the sculptures obviously came from the life of the vanished
epoch of their creation, and contained a large proportion of evident history. It is
this abnormal historic-mindedness of the primal race - a chance circumstance
operating, through coincidence, miraculously in our favor - which made the
carvings so awesomely informative to us, and which caused us to place their
photography and transcription above all other considerations. In certain rooms
the dominant arrangement was varied by the presence of maps, astronomical
charts, and other scientific designs of an enlarged scale - these things giving a
naive and terrible corroboration to what we gathered from the pictorial friezes
and dadoes. In hinting at what the whole revealed, I can only hope that my
account will not arouse a curiosity greater than sane caution on the part of those
who believe me at all. It would be tragic if any were to be allured to that realm of
death and horror by the very warning meant to discourage them.

Interrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive twelve-foot
doorways; both now and then retaining the petrified wooden planks -
elaborately carved and polished-of the actual shutters and doors. All metal
fixtures had long ago vanished, but some of the doors remained in place and had
to be forced aside as we progressed from room to room. Window frames with
odd transparent panes - mostly elliptical - survived here and there, though in no
considerable quantity. There were also frequent niches of great magnitude,
generally empty, but once in a while containing some bizarre object carved from
green soapstone which was either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant
removal. Other apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical
facilities - heating, lighting, and the like-of a sort suggested in many of the
carvings. Ceilings tended to be plain, but had sometimes been inlaid with green
soapstone or other tiles, mostly fallen now. Floors were also paved with such
tiles, though plain stonework predominated.


As I have said, all furniture and other movables were absent; but the sculptures
gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once filled these tomblike,
echoing rooms. Above the glacial sheet the floors were generally thick with
detritus, litter, and debris, but farther down this condition decreased. In some of
the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than gritty dust or
ancient incrustations, while occasional areas had an uncanny air of newly swept
immaculateness. Of course, where rifts or collapses had occurred, the lower
levels were as littered as the upper ones. A central court - as in other structures
we had seen from the air - saved the inner regions from total darkness; so that we
seldom had to use our electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying
sculptured details. Below the ice cap, however, the twilight deepened; and in
many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to absolute
blackness.

To form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we penetrated
this aeon-silent maze of unhuman masonry, one must correlate a hopelessly
bewildering chaos of fugitive moods, memories, and impressions. The sheer
appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the place were enough to overwhelm
almost any sensitive person, but added to these elements were the recent
unexplained horror at the camp, and the revelations all too soon effected by the
terrible mural sculptures around us. The moment we came upon a perfect section
of carving, where no ambiguity of interpretation could exist, it took only a brief
study to give us the hideous truth - a truth which it would be naive to claim
Danforth and I had not independently suspected before, though we had carefully
refrained from even hinting it to each other. There could now be no further
merciful doubt about the nature of the beings which had built and inhabited this
monstrous dead city millions of years ago, when man's ancestors were primitive
archaic mammals, and vast dinosaurs roamed the tropical steppes of Europe and
Asia.

We had previously clung to a desperate alternative and insisted - each to himself
- that the omnipresence of the five-pointed motifs meant only some cultural or
religious exaltation of the Archaean natural object which had so patently
embodied the quality of five-pointedness; as the decorative motifs of Minoan
Crete exalted the sacred bull, those of Egypt the scarabaeus, those of Rome the
wolf and the eagle, and those of various savage tribes some chosen totem animal.
But this lone refuge was now stripped from us, and we were forced to face
definitely the reason-shaking realization which the reader of these pages has
doubtless long ago anticipated. I can scarcely bear to write it down in black and
white even now, but perhaps that will not be necessary.

The things once rearing and dwelling in this frightful masonry in the age of
dinosaurs were not indeed dinosaurs, but far worse. Mere dinosaurs were new


and almost brainless objects - but the builders of the city were wise and old, and
had left certain traces in rocks even then laid down well nigh a thousand million
years - rocks laid down before the true life of earth had advanced beyond plastic
groups of cells - rocks laid down before the true life of earth had existed at all.
They were the makers and enslavers of that life, and above all doubt the originals
of the fiendish elder myths which things like the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the
Necronomicon affrightedly hint about. They were the great "Old Ones" that had
filtered down from the stars when earth was young - the beings whose substance
an alien evolution had shaped, and whose powers were such as this planet had
never bred. And to think that only the day before Danforth and I had actually
looked upon fragments of their millennially fossilized substance - and that poor
Lake and his party had seen their complete outlines - It is of course impossible
for me to relate in proper order the stages by which we picked up what we know
of that monstrous chapter of prehuman life. After the first shock of the certain
revelation, we had to pause a while to recuperate, and it was fully three o'clock
before we got started on our actual tour of systematic research. The sculptures in
the building we entered were of relatively late date - perhaps two million years
ago-as checked up by geological, biological, and astronomical features - and
embodied an art which would be called decadent in comparison with that of
specimens we found in older buildings after crossing bridges under the glacial
sheet. One edifice hewn from the solid rock seemed to go back forty or possibly
even fifty million years - to the lower Eocene or upper Cretaceous - and
contained bas-reliefs of an artistry surpassing anything else, with one
tremendous exception, that we encountered. That was, we have since agreed, the
oldest domestic structure we traversed.

Were it not for the support of those flashlights soon to be made public, I would
refrain from telling what I found and inferred, lest I be confined as a madman. Of
course, the infinitely early parts of the patchwork tale - representing the
preterrestrial life of the star-headed beings on other planets, in other galaxies,
and in other universes - can readily be interpreted as the fantastic mythology of
those beings themselves; yet such parts sometimes involved designs and
diagrams so uncannily close to the latest findings of mathematics and
astrophysics that I scarcely know what to think. Let others judge when they see
the photographs I shall publish.

Naturally, no one set of carvings which we encountered told more than a fraction
of any connected story, nor did we even begin to come upon the various stages
of that story in their proper order. Some of the vast rooms were independent
units so far as their designs were concerned, whilst in other cases a continuous
chronicle would be carried through a series of rooms and corridors. The best of
the maps and diagrams were on the walls of a frightful abyss below even the
ancient ground level - a cavern perhaps two hundred feet square and sixty feet


high, which had almost undoubtedly been an educational center of some sort.
There were many provoking repetitions of the same material in different rooms
and buildings, since certain chapters of experience, and certain summaries or
phases of racial history, had evidently been favorites with different decorators or
dwellers. Sometimes, though, variant versions of the same theme proved useful
in settling debatable points and filling up gaps.

I still wonder that we deduced so much in the short time at our disposal. Of
course, we even now have only the barest outline - and much of that was
obtained later on from a study of the photographs and sketches we made. It may
be the effect of this later study - the revived memories and vague impressions
acting in conjunction with his general sensitiveness and with that final supposed
horror-glimpse whose essence he will not reveal even to me - which has been the
immediate source of Danforth's present breakdown. But it had to be; for we
could not issue our warning intelligently without the fullest possible
information, and the issuance of that warning is a prime necessity. Certain
lingering influences in that unknown antarctic world of disordered time and
alien natural law make it imperative that further exploration be discouraged.

VII

The full story, so far as deciphered, will eventually appear in an official bulletin
of Miskatonic University. Here I shall sketch only the salient highlights in a
formless, rambling way. Myth or otherwise, the sculptures told of the coming of
those star-headed things to the nascent, lifeless earth out of cosmic space - their
coming, and the coming of many other alien entities such as at certain times
embark upon spatial pioneering. They seemed able to traverse the interstellar
ether on their vast membranous wings - thus oddly confirming some curious hill
folklore long ago told me by an antiquarian colleague. They had lived under the
sea a good deal, building fantastic cities and fighting terrific battles with
nameless adversaries by means of intricate devices employing unknown
principles of energy. Evidently their scientific and mechanical knowledge far
surpassed man's today, though they made use of its more widespread and
elaborate forms only when obliged to. Some of the sculptures suggested that they
had passed through a stage of mechanized life on other planets, but had receded
upon finding its effects emotionally unsatisfying. Their preternatural toughness
of organization and simplicity of natural wants made them peculiarly able to live
on a high plane without the more specialized fruits of artificial manufacture, and
even without garments, except for occasional protection against the elements.

It was under the sea, at first for food and later for other purposes, that they first
created earth life - using available substances according to long-known methods.
The more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various cosmic



enemies. They had done the same thing on other planets, having manufactured
not only necessary foods, but certain multicellular protoplasmic masses capable
of molding their tissues into all sorts of temporary organs under hypnotic
influence and thereby forming ideal slaves to perform the heavy work of the
community. These viscous masses were without doubt what Abdul Alhazred
whispered about as the "Shoggoths" in his frightful Necronomicon, though even
that mad Arab had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the dreams of
those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb. When the star-headed Old Ones
on this planet had synthesized their simple food forms and bred a good supply
of Shoggoths, they allowed other cell groups to develop into other forms of
animal and vegetable life for sundry purposes, extirpating any whose presence
became troublesome.

With the aid of the Shoggoths, whose expansions could be made to lift
prodigious weights, the small, low cities under the sea grew to vast and
imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which later rose on land. Indeed,
the highly adaptable Old Ones had lived much on land in other parts of the
universe, and probably retained many traditions of land construction. As we
studied the architecture of all these sculptured palaeogean cities, including that
whose aeon-dead corridors we were even then traversing, we were impressed by
a curious coincidence which we have not yet tried to explain, even to ourselves.
The tops of the buildings, which in the actual city around us had, of course, been
weathered into shapeless ruins ages ago, were clearly displayed in the bas-
reliefs, and showed vast clusters of needle-like spires, delicate finials on certain
cone and pyramid apexes, and tiers of thin, horizontal scalloped disks capping
cylindrical shafts. This was exactly what we had seen in that monstrous and
portentous mirage, cast by a dead city whence such skyline features had been
absent for thousands and tens of thousands of years, which loomed on our
ignorant eyes across the unfathomed mountains of madness as we first
approached poor Lake's ill-fated camp.

Of the life of the Old Ones, both under the sea and after part of them migrated to
land, volumes could be written. Those in shallow water had continued the fullest
use of the eyes at the ends of their five main head tentacles, and had practiced
the arts of sculpture and of writing in quite the usual way - the writing
accomplished with a stylus on waterproof waxen surfaces. Those lower down in
the ocean depths, though they used a curious phosphorescent organism to
furnish light, pieced out their vision with obscure special senses operating
through the prismatic cilia on their heads - senses which rendered all the Old
Ones partly independent of light in emergencies. Their forms of sculpture and
writing had changed curiously during the descent, embodying certain
apparently chemical coating processes - probably to secure phosphorescence -
which the basreliefs could not make clear to us. The beings moved in the sea


partly by swimming - using the lateral crinoid arms - and partly by wriggling
with the lower tier of tentacles containing the pseudofeet. Occasionally they
accomplished long swoops with the auxiliary use of two or more sets of their
fanlike folding wings. On land they locally used the pseudofeet, but now and
then flew to great heights or over long distances with their wings. The many
slender tentacles into which the crinoid arms branched were infinitely delicate,
flexible, strong, and accurate in muscular-nervous coordination - ensuring the
utmost skill and dexterity in all artistic and other manual operations.

The toughness of the things was almost incredible. Even the terrific pressure of
the deepest sea bottoms appeared powerless to harm them. Very few seemed to
die at all except by violence, and their burial places were very limited. The fact
that they covered their vertically inhumed dead with five-pointed inscribed
mounds set up thoughts in Danforth and me which made a fresh pause and
recuperation necessary after the sculptures revealed it. The beings multiplied by
means of spores - like vegetable pteridophytes, as Lake had suspected - but,
owing to their prodigious toughness and longevity, and consequent lack of
replacement needs, they did not encourage the large-scale development of new
prothallia except when they had new regions to colonize. The young matured
swiftly, and received an education evidently beyond any standard we can
imagine. The prevailing intellectual and aesthetic life was highly evolved, and
produced a tenaciously enduring set of customs and institutions which I shall
describe more fully in my coming monograph. These varied slightly according to
sea or land residence, but had the same foundations and essentials.

Though able, like vegetables, to derive nourishment from inorganic substances,
they vastly preferred organic and especially animal food. They ate uncooked
marine life under the sea, but cooked their viands on land. They hunted game
and raised meat herds - slaughtering with sharp weapons whose odd marks on
certain fossil bones our expedition had noted. They resisted all ordinary
temperatures marvelously, and in their natural state could live in water down to
freezing. When the great chill of the Pleistocene drew on, however - nearly a
million years ago-the land dwellers had to resort to special measures, including
artificial heating - until at last the deadly cold appears to have driven them back
into the sea. For their prehistoric flights through cosmic space, legend said, they
absorbed certain chemicals and became almost independent of eating, breathing,
or heat conditions - but by the time of the great cold they had lost track of the
method. In any case they could not have prolonged the artificial state indefinitely
without harm.

Being nonpairing and semivegetable in structure, the Old Ones had no biological
basis for the family phase of mammal life, but seemed to organize large
households on the principles of comfortable space- utility and - as we deduced



bl



from the pictured occupations and diversions of co-dwellers - congenial mental
association. In furnishing their homes they kept everything in the center of the
huge rooms, leaving all the wall spaces free for decorative treatment. Lighting, in
the case of the land inhabitants, was accomplished by a device probably electro-
chemical in nature. Both on land and under water they used curious tables,
chairs and couches like cylindrical frames - for they rested and slept upright with
folded- down tentacles - and racks for hinged sets of dotted surfaces forming
their books.

Government was evidently complex and probably socialistic, though no
certainties in this regard could be deduced from the sculptures we saw. There
was extensive commerce, both local and between different cities - certain small,
flat counters, five-pointed and inscribed, serving as money. Probably the smaller
of the various greenish soapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such
currency. Though the culture was mainly urban, some agriculture and much
stock raising existed. Mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also
practiced. Travel was very frequent, but permanent migration seemed relatively
rare except for the vast colonizing movements by which the race expanded. For
personal locomotion no external aid was used, since in land, air, and water
movement alike the Old Ones seemed to possess excessively vast capacities for
speed. Loads, however, were drawn by beasts of burden - Shoggoths under the
sea, and a curious variety of primitive vertebrates in the later years of land
existence.

These vertebrates, as well as an infinity of other life forms - animal and
vegetable, marine, terrestrial, and aerial - were the products of unguided
evolution acting on life cells made by the Old Ones, but escaping beyond their
radius of attention. They had been suffered to develop unchecked because they
had not come in conflict with the dominant beings. Bothersome forms, of course,
were mechanically exterminated. It interested us to see in some of the very last
and most decadent sculptures a shambling, primitive mammal, used sometimes
for food and sometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers, whose
vaguely simian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable. In the building
of land cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally lifted by
vast-winged pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to paleontology.

The persistence with which the Old Ones survived various geologic changes and
convulsions of the earth's crust was little short of miraculous. Though few or
none of their first cities seem to have remained beyond the Archaean Age, there
was no interruption in their civilization or in the transmission of their records.
Their original place of advent to the planet was the Antarctic Ocean, and it is
likely that they came not long after the matter forming the moon was wrenched
from the neighboring South Pacific. According to one of the sculptured maps the



whole globe was then under water, with stone cities scattered farther and farther
from the antarctic as aeons passed. Another map shows a vast bulk of dry land
around the south pole, where it is evident that some of the beings made
experimental settlements, though their main centers were transferred to the
nearest sea bottom. Later maps, which display the land mass as cracking and
drifting, and sending certain detached parts northward, uphold in a striking way
the theories of continental drift lately advanced by Taylor, Wegener, and Joly.

With the upheaval of new land in the South Pacific tremendous events began.
Some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered, yet that was not the worst
misfortune. Another race - a land race of beings shaped like octopi and probably
corresponding to fabulous prehuman spawn of Cthulhu - soon began filtering
down from cosmic infinity and precipitated a -monstrous war which for a time
drove the Old Ones wholly back to the sea - a colossal blow in view of the
increasing land settlements. Later peace was made, and the new lands were
given to the Cthulhu spawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the older
lands. New land cities were founded - the greatest of them in the antarctic, for
this region of first arrival was sacred. From then on, as before, the antarctic
remained the center of the Old Ones' civilization, and all the cities built there by
the Cthulhu spawn were blotted out. Then suddenly the lands of the Pacific sank
again, taking with them the frightful stone city of R'lyeh and all the cosmic
octopi, so that the Old Ones were again supreme on the planet except for one
shadowy fear about which they did not like to speak. At a rather later age their
cities dotted all the land and water areas of the globe - hence the
recommendation in my coming monograph that some archaeologist make
systematic borings with Pabodie's type of apparatus in certain widely separated
regions.

The steady trend down the ages was from water to land - a movement
encouraged by the rise of new land masses, though the ocean was never wholly
deserted. Another cause of the landward movement was the new difficulty in
breeding and managing the Shoggoths upon which successful sea life depended.
With the march of time, as the sculptures sadly confessed, the art of creating new
life from inorganic matter had been lost, so that the Old Ones had to depend on
the molding of forms already in existence. On land the great reptiles proved
highly tractable; but the Shoggoths of the sea, reproducing by fission and
acquiring a dangerous degree of accidental intelligence, presented for a time a
formidable problem.

They had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestions of the Old
Ones, and had modeled their tough plasticity into various useful temporary
limbs and organs; but now their self-modeling powers were sometimes exercised
independently, and in various imitative forms implanted by past suggestion.


They had, it seems, developed a semistable brain whose separate and
occasionally stubborn volition echoed the will of the Old Ones without always
obeying it. Sculptured images of these Shoggoths filled Danforth and me with
horror and loathing. They were normally shapeless entities composed of a
viscous jelly which looked like an agglutination of bubbles, and each averaged
about fifteen feet in diameter when a sphere. They had, however, a constantly
shifting shape and volume - throwing out temporary developments or forming
apparent organs of sight, hearing, and speech in imitation of their masters, either
spontaneously or according to suggestion.

They seem to have become peculiarly intractable toward the middle of the
Permian Age, perhaps one hundred and fifty million years ago, when a veritable
war of resubjugation was waged upon them by the marine Old Ones. Pictures of
this war, and of the headless, slime-coated fashion in which the Shoggoths
typically left their slain victims, held a marvelously fearsome quality despite the
intervening abyss of untold ages. The Old Ones had used curious weapons of
molecular and atomic disturbances against the rebel entities, and in the end had
achieved a complete victory. Thereafter the sculptures showed a period in which
Shoggoths were tamed and broken by armed Old Ones as the wild horses of the
American west were tamed by cowboys. Though during the rebellion the
Shoggoths had shown an ability to live out of water, this transition was not
encouraged - since their usefulness on land would hardly have been
commensurate with the trouble of their management.

During the Jurassic Age the Old Ones met fresh adversity in the form of a new
invasion from outer space - this time by half-fungous, half-crustacean creatures -
creatures undoubtedly the same as those figuring in certain whispered hill
legends of the north, and remembered in the Himalayas as the Mi-Go, or
abominable Snow Men. To fight these beings the Old Ones attempted, for the
first time since their terrene advent, to sally forth again into the planetary ether;
but, despite all traditional preparations, found it no longer possible to leave the
earth's atmosphere. Whatever the old secret of interstellar travel had been, it was
now definitely lost to the race. In the end the Mi-Go drove the Old Ones out of all
the northern lands, though they were powerless to disturb those in the sea. Little
by little the slow retreat of the elder race to their original antarctic habitat was
beginning.

It was curious to note from the pictured battles that both the Cthulhu spawn and
the Mi-Go seem to have been composed of matter more widely different from
that which we know than was the substance of the Old Ones. They were able to
undergo transformations and reintegrations impossible for their adversaries, and
seem therefore to have originally come from even remoter gulfs of the cosmic
space. The Old Ones, but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital




properties, were strictly material, and must have had their absolute origin within
the known space-time continuum - whereas the first sources of the other beings
can only be guessed at with bated breath. All this, of course, assuming that the
non-terrestrial linkages and the anomalies ascribed to the invading foes are not
pure mythology. Conceivably, the Old Ones might have invented a cosmic
framework to account for their occasional defeats, since historical interest and
pride obviously formed their chief psychological element. It is significant that
their annals failed to mention many advanced and potent races of beings whose
mighty cultures and towering cities figure persistently in certain obscure
legends.

The changing state of the world through long geologic ages appeared with
startling vividness in many of the sculptured maps and scenes. In certain cases
existing science will require revision, while in other cases its bold deductions are
magnificently confirmed. As I have said, the hypothesis of Taylor, Wegener, and
Joly that all the continents are fragments of an original antarctic land mass which
cracked from centrifugal force and drifted apart over a technically viscous lower
surface - an hypothesis suggested by such things as the complementary outlines
of Africa and South America, and the way the great mountain chains are rolled
and shoved up - receives striking support from this uncanny source.

Maps evidently showing the Carboniferous world of an hundred million or more
years ago displayed significant rifts and chasms destined later to separate Africa
from the once continuous realms of Europe (then the Valusia of primal legend),
Asia, the Americas, and the antarctic continent. Other charts - and most
significantly one in connection with the founding fifty million years ago of the
vast dead city around us - showed all the present continents well differentiated.
And in the latest discoverable specimen - dating perhaps from the Pliocene Age -
the approximate world of today appeared quite clearly despite the linkage of
Alaska with Siberia, of North America with Europe through Greenland, and of
South America with the antarctic continent through Graham Land. In the
Carboniferous map the whole globe-ocean floor and rifted land mass alike - bore
symbols of the Old Ones' vast stone cities, but in the later charts the gradual
recession toward the antarctic became very plain. The final Pliocene specimen
showed no land cities except on the antarctic continent and the tip of South
America, nor any ocean cities north of the fiftieth parallel of South Latitude.
Knowledge and interest in the northern world, save for a study of coast lines
probably made during long exploration flights on those fanlike membranous
wings, had evidently declined to zero among the Old Ones.

Destruction of cities through the upthrust of mountains, the centrifugal rending
of continents, the seismic convulsions of land or sea bottom, and other natural
causes, was a matter of common record; and it was curious to observe how fewer



and fewer replacements were made as the ages wore on. The vast dead
megalopoHs that yawned around us seemed to be the last general center of the
race - built early in the Cretaceous Age after a titanic earth buckling had
obliterated a still vaster predecessor not far distant. It appeared that this general
region was the most sacred spot of all, where reputedly the first Old Ones had
settled on a primal sea bottom. In the new city - many of whose features we
could recognize in the sculptures, but which stretched fully a hundred miles
along the mountain range in each direction beyond the farthest limits of our
aerial survey - there were reputed to be preserved certain sacred stones forming
part of the first sea-bottom city, which thrust up to light after long epochs in the
course of the general crumbling of strata.

VIII

Naturally, Danforth and I studied with especial interest and a peculiarly
personal sense of awe everything pertaining to the immediate district in which
we were. Of this local material there was naturally a vast abundance; and on the
tangled ground level of the city we were lucky enough to find a house of very
late date whose walls, though somewhat damaged by a neighboring rift,
contained sculptures of decadent workmanship carrying the story of the region
much beyond the period of the Pliocene map whence we derived our last general
glimpse of the prehuman world. This was the last place we examined in detail,
since what we found there gave us a fresh immediate objective.

Certainly, we were in one of the strangest, weirdest, and most terrible of all the
corners of earth's globe. Of all existing lands, it was infinitely the most ancient.
The conviction grew upon us that this hideous upland must indeed be the fabled
nightmare plateau of Leng which even the mad author of the Necronomicon was
reluctant to discuss. The great mountain chain was tremendously long - starting
as a low range at Luitpold Land on the east coast of Weddell Sea and virtually
crossing the entire continent. That really high part stretched in a mighty arc from
about Latitude 82°, E. Longitude 60° to Latitude 70°, E. Longitude 115°, with its
concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the region of that long, ice-
locked coast whose hills were glimpsed by Wilkes and Mawson at the antarctic
circle.

Yet even more monstrous exaggerations of nature seemed disturbingly close at
hand. I have said that these peaks are higher than the Himalayas, but the
sculptures forbid me to say that they are earth's highest. That grim honor is
beyond doubt reserved for something which half the sculptures hesitated to
record at all, whilst others approached it with obvious repugnance and
trepidation. It seems that there was one part of the ancient land - the first part
that ever rose from the waters after the earth had flung off the moon and the Old


Ones had seeped down, from the stars - which had come to be shunned as
vaguely and namelessly evil. Cities built there had crumbled before their time,
and had been found suddenly deserted. Then when the first great earth buckling
had convulsed the region in the Comanchian Age, a frightful line of peaks had
shot suddenly up amidst the most appalling din and chaos - and earth had
received her loftiest and most terrible mountains.

If the scale of the carvings was correct, these abhorred things must have been
much over forty thousand feet high - radically vaster than even the shocking
mountains of madness we had crossed. They extended, it appeared, from about
Latitude 77°, E. Longitude 70° to Latitude 70°, E. Longitude 100° - less than three
hundred miles away from the dead city, so that we would have spied their
dreaded summits in the dim western distance had it not been for that vague,
opalescent haze. Their northern end must likewise be visible from the long
antarctic circle coast line at Queen Mary Land.

Some of the Old Ones, in the decadent days, had made strange prayers to those
mountains - but none ever went near them or dared to guess what lay beyond.
No human eye had ever seen them, and as I studied the emotions conveyed in
the carvings, I prayed that none ever might. There are protecting hills along the
coast beyond them - Queen Mary and Kaiser Wilhelm Lands - and I thank
Heaven no one has been able to land and climb those hills. I am not as sceptical
about old tales and fears as I used to be, and I do not laugh now at the prehuman
sculptor's notion that lightning paused meaningfully now and then at each of the
brooding crests, and that an unexplained glow shone from one of those terrible
pinnacles all through the long polar night. There may be a very real and very
monstrous meaning in the old Pnakotic whispers about Kadath in the Cold
Waste.

But the terrain close at hand was hardly less strange, even if less namelessly
accursed. Soon after the founding of the city the great mountain range became
the seat of the principal temples, and many carvings showed what grotesque and
fantastic towers had pierced the sky where now we saw only the curiously
clinging cubes and ramparts. In the course of ages the caves had appeared, and
had been shaped into adjuncts of the temples. With the advance of still later
epochs, all the limestone veins of the region were hollowed out by ground
waters, so that the mountains, the foothills, and the plains below them were a
veritable network of connected caverns and galleries. Many graphic sculptures
told of explorations deep underground, and of the final discovery of the Stygian
sunless sea that lurked at earth's bowels.

This vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river which
flowed down from the nameless and horrible westward mountains, and which


had formerly turned at the base of the Old Ones' range and flowed beside that
chain into the Indian Ocean between Budd and Totten Lands on Wilkes's coast
line. Little by little it had eaten away the limestone hill base at its turning, till at
last its sapping currents reached the caverns of the ground waters and joined
with them in digging a deeper abyss. Finally its whole bulk emptied into the
hollow hills and left the old bed toward the ocean dry. Much of the later city as
we now found it had been built over that former bed. The Old Ones,
understanding what had happened, and exercising their always keen artistic
sense, had carved into ornate pylons those headlands of the foothills where the
great stream began its descent into eternal darkness.

This river, once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges, was plainly the one
whose extinct course we had seen in our aeroplane survey. Its position in
different carvings of the city helped us to orient ourselves to the scene as it had
been at various stages of the region's age-long, aeon-dead history, so that we
were able to sketch a hasty but careful map of the salient features - squares,
important buildings, and the like - for guidance in further explorations. We could
soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it was a million or ten
million or fifty million years ago, for the sculptures told us exactly what the
buildings and mountains and squares and suburbs and landscape setting and
luxuriant Tertiary vegetation had looked like. It must have had a marvelous and
mystic beauty, and as I thought of it, I almost forgot the clammy sense of sinister
oppression with which the city's inhuman age and massiveness and deadness
and remoteness and glacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit. Yet
according to certain carvings, the denizens of that city had themselves known the
clutch of oppressive terror; for there was a somber and recurrent type of scene in
which the Old Ones were shown in the act of recoiling affrightedly from some
object - never allowed to appear in the design - found in the great river and
indicated as having been washed down through waving, vine-draped cycad
forests from those horrible westward mountains.

It was only in the one late-built house with the decadent carvings that we
obtained any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the city's desertion.
Undoubtedly there must have been many sculptures of the same age elsewhere,
even allowing for the slackened energies and aspirations of a stressful and
uncertain period; indeed, very certain evidence of the existence of others came to
us shortly afterward. But this was the first and only set we directly encountered.
We meant to look farther later on; but as I have said, immediate conditions
dictated another present objective. There would, though, have been a limit - for
after all hope of a long future occupancy of the place had perished among the
Old Ones, there could not but have been a complete cessation of mural
decoration. The ultimate blow, of course, was the coming of the great cold which
once held most of the earth in thrall, and which has never departed from the ill-



fated poles - the great cold that, at the world's other extremity, put an end to the
fabled lands of Lomar and Hyperborea.

Just when this tendency began in the antarctic, it would be hard to say in terms
of exact years. Nowadays we set the beginning of the general glacial periods at a
distance of about five hundred thousand years from the present, but at the poles
the terrible scourge must have commenced much earlier. All quantitative
estimates are partly guesswork, but it is quite likely that the decadent sculptures
were made considerably less than a million years ago, and that the actual
desertion of the city was complete long before the conventional opening of the
Pleistocene - five hundred thousand years ago - as reckoned in terms of the
earth's whole surface.

In the decadent sculptures there were signs of thinner vegetation everywhere,
and of a decreased country life on the part of the Old Ones. Heating devices were
shown in the houses, and winter travelers were represented as muffled in
protective fabrics. Then we saw a series of cartouches - the continuous band
arrangement being frequently interrupted in these late carvings - depicting a
constantly growing migration to the nearest refuges of greater warmth - some
fleeing to cities under the sea off the far-away coast, and some clambering down
through networks of limestone caverns in the hollow hills to the neighboring
black abyss of subterrene waters.

In the end it seems to have been the neighboring abyss which received the
greatest colonization. This was partly due, no doubt, to the traditional sacredness
of this special region, but may have been more conclusively determined by the
opportunities it gave for continuing the use of the great temples on the
honeycombed mountains, and for retaining the vast land city as a place of
summer residence and base of communication with various mines. The linkage
of old and new abodes was made more effective by means of several gradings
and improvements along the connecting routes, including the chiseling of
numerous direct tunnels from the ancient metropolis to the black abyss - sharply
down-pointing tunnels whose mouths we carefully drew, according to our most
thoughtful estimates, on the guide map we were compiling. It was obvious that
at least two of these tunnels lay within a reasonable exploring distance of where
we were - both being on the mountainward edge of the city, one less than a
quarter of a mile toward the ancient river course, and the other perhaps twice
that distance in the opposite direction.

The abyss, it seems, had shelving shores of dry land at certain places, but the Old
Ones built their new city under water - no doubt because of its greater certainty
of uniform warmth. The depth of the hidden sea appears to have been very great,
so that the earth's internal heat could ensure its habitability for an indefinite


period. The beings seemed to have had no trouble in adapting themselves to
part-time - and eventually, of course, whole-time - residence under water, since
they had never allowed their gill systems to atrophy. There were many
sculptures which showed how they had always frequently visited their
submarine kinsfolk elsewhere, and how they had habitually bathed on the deep
bottom of their great river. The darkness of inner earth could likewise have been
no deterrent to a race accustomed to long antarctic nights.

Decadent though their style undoubtedly was, these latest carvings had a truly
epic quality where they told of the building of the new city in the cavern sea. The
Old Ones had gone about it scientifically - quarrying insoluble rocks from the
heart of the honeycombed mountains, and employing expert workers from the
nearest submarine city to perform the construction according to the best
methods. These workers brought with them all that was necessary to establish
the new venture - Shoggoth tissue from which to breed stone lifters and
subsequent beasts of burden for the cavern city, and other protoplasmic matter to
mold into phosphorescent organisms for lighting purposes.

At last a mighty metropolis rose on the bottom of that Stygian sea, its
architecture much like that of the city above, and its workmanship displaying
relatively little decadence because of the precise mathematical element inherent
in building operations. The newly bred Shoggoths grew to enormous size and
singular intelligence, and were represented as taking and executing orders with
marvelous quickness. They seemed to converse with the Old Ones by mimicking
their voices - a sort of musical piping over a wide range, if poor Lake's dissection
had indicated aright - and to work more from spoken commands than from
hypnotic suggestions as in earlier times. They were, however, kept in admirable
control. The phosphorescent organisms supplied light With vast effectiveness,
and doubtless atoned for the loss of the familiar polar auroras of the outer-world
night.

Art and decoration were pursued, though of course with a certain decadence.
The Old Ones seemed to realize this falling off themselves, and in many cases
anticipated the policy of Constantine the Great by transplanting especially fine
blocks of ancient carving from their land city, just as the emperor, in a similar age
of decline, stripped Greece and Asia of their finest art to give his new Byzantine
capital greater splendors than its own people could create. That the transfer of
sculptured blocks had not been more extensive was doubtless owing to the fact
that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned. By the time total
abandonment did occur - and it surely must have occurred before the polar
Pleistocene was far advanced - the Old Ones had perhaps become satisfied with
their decadent art - or had ceased to recognize the superior merit of the older
carvings. At any rate, the aeon-silent ruins around us had certainly undergone no


wholesale sculptural denudation, though all the best separate statues, like other
movables, had been taken away.

The decadent cartouches and dadoes telling this story were, as I have said, the
latest we could find in our limited search. They left us with a picture of the Old
Ones shuttling back and forth betwixt the land city in summer and the sea-
cavern city in winter, and sometimes trading with the sea-bottom cities off the
antarctic coast. By this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been
recognized, for the sculptures showed many signs of the cold's malign
encroachments. Vegetation was declining, and the terrible snows of the winter
no longer melted completely even in midsummer. The saunan livestock were
nearly all dead, and the mammals were standing it none too well. To keep on
with the work of the upper world it had become necessary to adapt some of the
amorphous and curiously cold-resistant Shoggoths to land life - a thing the Old
Ones had formerly been reluctant to do. The great river was now lifeless, and the
upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales. All the birds
had flown away, save only the great, grotesque penguins.

What had happened afterward we could only guess. How long had the new sea-
cavern city survived? Was it still down there, a stony corpse in eternal blackness?
Had the subterranean waters frozen at last? To what fate had the ocean-bottom
cities of the outer world been delivered? Had any of the Old Ones shifted north
ahead of the creeping ice cap? Existing geology shows no trace of their presence.
Had the frightful Mi-Go been still a menace in the outer land world of the north?
Could one be sure of what might or might not linger, even to this day, in the
lightless and unplumbed abysses of earth's deepest waters? Those things had
seemingly been able to withstand any amount of pressure - and men of the sea
have fished up curious objects at times. And has the killer-whale theory really
explained the savage and mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation
ago by Borchgrevingk?

The specimens found by poor Lake did not enter into these guesses, for their
geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been a very early
date in the land city's history. They were, according to their location, certainly
not less than thirty million years old, and we reflected that in their day the sea-
cavern city, and indeed the cavern itself, had had no existence. They would have
remembered an older scene, with lush Tertiary vegetation everywhere, a
younger land city of flourishing arts around them, and a great river sweeping
northward along the base of the mighty mountains toward a far-away tropic
ocean.

And yet we could not help thinking about these specimens - especially about the
eight perfect ones that were missing from Lake's hideously ravaged camp. There


was something abnormal about that whole business - the strange things we had
tried so hard to lay to somebody's madness - those frightful graves - the amount
and nature of the missing material - Gedney - the unearthly toughness of those
archaic monstrosities, and the queer vital freaks the sculptures now showed the
race to have - Danforth and I had seen a good deal in the last few hours, and
were prepared to believe and keep silent about many appalling and incredible
secrets of primal nature.

IX

I have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a change in
our immediate objective. This, of course, had to do with the chiseled avenues to
the black inner world, of whose existence we had not known before, but which
we were now eager to find and traverse. From the evident scale of the carvings
we deduced that a steeply descending walk of about a mile through either of the
neighboring tunnels would bring us to the brink of the dizzy, sunless cliffs about
the great abyss; down whose sides paths, improved by the Old Ones, led to the
rocky shore of the hidden and nighted ocean. To behold this fabulous gulf in
stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of resistance once we knew of
the thing - yet we realized we must begin the quest at once if we expected to
include it in our present trip.

It was now 8 P.M., and we did not have enough battery replacements to let our
torches burn on forever. We had done so much studying and copying below the
glacial level that our battery supply had had at least five hours of nearly
continuous use, and despite the special dry cell formula, would obviously be
good for only about four more - though by keeping one torch unused, except for
especially interesting or difficult places, we might manage to eke out a safe
margin beyond that. It would not do to be without a light in these Cyclopean
catacombs, hence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further
mural deciphering. Of course we intended to revisit the place for days and
perhaps weeks of intensive study and photography - curiosity having long ago
got the better of horror - but just now we must hasten.

Our supply of trail-blazing paper was far from unlimited, and we were reluctant
to sacrifice spare notebooks or sketching paper to augment it, but we did let one
large notebook go. If worse came to worst we could resort to rock chipping - and
of course it would be possible, even in case of really lost direction, to work up to
full daylight by one channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful
trial and error. So at last we set off eagerly in the indicated direction of the
nearest tunnel.



According to the carvings from which we had made our map, the desired tunnel
mouth could not be much more than a quarter of a mile from where we stood;
the intervening space showing solid-looking buildings quite likely to be
penetrable still at a sub-glacial level. The opening itself would be in the basement
- on the angle nearest the foothills - of a vast five-pointed structure of evidently
public and perhaps ceremonial nature, which we tried to identify from our aerial
survey of the ruins.

No such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight, hence we
concluded that its upper parts had been greatly damaged, or that it had been
totally shattered in an ice rift we had noticed. In the latter case the tunnel would
probably turn out to be choked, so that we would have to try the next nearest
one - the one less than a mile to the north. The intervening river course
prevented our trying any of the more southern tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if
both of the neighboring ones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries
would warrant an attempt on the next northerly one - about a mile beyond our
second choice.

As we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map and
compass - traversing rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or preservation,
clambering up ramps, crossing upper floors and bridges and clambering down
again, encountering choked doorways and piles of debris, hastening now and
then along finely preserved and uncannily immaculate stretches, taking false
leads and retracing our way (in such cases removing the blind paper trail we had
left), and once in a while striking the bottom of an open shaft through which
daylight poured or trickled down - we were repeatedly tantalized by the
sculptured walls along our route. Many must have told tales of immense
historical importance, and only the prospect of later visits reconciled us to the
need of passing them by. As it was, we slowed down once in a while and turned
on our second torch. If we had had more films, we would certainly have paused
briefly to photograph certain bas-reliefs, but time-consuming hand-copying was
clearly out of the question.

I come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate, or to hint
rather than state, is very strong. It is necessary, however, to reveal the rest in
order to justify my course in discouraging further exploration. We had wormed
our way very close to the computed site of the tunnel's mouth - having crossed a
second-story bridge to what seemed plainly the tip of a pointed wall, and
descended to a ruinous corridor especially rich in decadently elaborate and
apparently ritualistic sculptures of late workmanship - when, shortly before 8:30
P.M., Danforth's keen young nostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual.
If we had had a dog with us, I suppose we would have been warned before. At
first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the formerly crystal-pure


air, but after a few seconds our memories reacted only too definitely. Let me try
to state the thing without flinching. There was an odor - and that odor was
vaguely, subtly, and unmistakably akin to what had nauseated us upon opening
the insane grave of the horror poor Lake had dissected.

Of course the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it sounds now. There
were several conceivable explanations, and we did a good deal of indecisive
whispering. Most important of all, we did not retreat without further
investigation; for having come this far, we were loath to be balked by anything
short of certain disaster. Anyway, what we must have suspected was altogether
too wild to believe. Such things did not happen in any normal world. It was
probably sheer irrational instinct which made us dim our single torch - tempted
no longer by the decadent and sinister sculptures that leered menacingly from
the oppressive walls - and which softened our progress to a cautious tiptoeing
and crawling over the increasingly littered floor and heaps of debris.

Danforth's eyes as well as nose proved better than mine, for it was likewise he
who first noticed the queer aspect of the debris after we had passed many half-
choked arches leading to chambers and corridors on the ground level. It did not
look quite as it ought after countless thousands of years of desertion, and when
we cautiously turned on more light we saw that a kind of swath seemed to have
been lately tracked through it. The irregular nature of the litter precluded any
definite marks, but in the smoother places there were suggestions of the
dragging of heavy objects. Once we thought there was a hint of parallel tracks as
if of runners. This was what made us pause again.

It was during that pause that we caught - simultaneously this time - the other
odor ahead. Paradoxically, it was both a less frightful and more frightful odor -
less frightful intrinsically, but infinitely appalling in this place under the known
circumstances - unless, of course, Gedney - for the odor was the plain and
familiar one of common petrol - every-day gasoline.

Our motivation after that is something I will leave to psychologists. We knew
now that some terrible extension of the camp horrors must have crawled into this
nighted burial place of the aeons, hence could not doubt any longer the existence
of nameless conditions - present or at least recent just ahead. Yet in the end we
did let sheer burning curiosity-or anxiety-or autohypnotism - or vague thoughts
of responsibility toward Gedney - or what not - drive us on. Danforth whispered
again of the print he thought he had seen at the alley turning in the ruins above;
and of the faint musical piping - potentially of tremendous significance in the
light of Lake's dissection report, despite its close resemblance to the cave-mouth
echoes of the windy peaks - which he thought he had shortly afterward half
heard from unknown depths below. I, in my turn, whispered of how the camp


was left - of what had disappeared, and of how the madness of a lone survivor
might have conceived the inconceivable - a wild trip across the monstrous
mountains and a descent into the unknown, primal masonry - But we could not
convince each other, or even ourselves, of anything definite. We had turned off
all light as we stood still, and vaguely noticed that a trace of deeply filtered
upper day kept the blackness from being absolute. Having automatically begun
to move ahead, we guided ourselves by occasional flashes from our torch. The
disturbed debris formed an impression we could not shake off, and the smell of
gasoline grew stronger. More and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our
feet, until very soon we saw that the forward way was about to cease. We had
been all too correct in our pessimistic guess about that rift glimpsed from the air.
Our tunnel quest was a blind one, and we were not even going to be able to
reach the basement out of which the abyssward aperture opened.

The torch, flashing over the grotesquely carved walls of the blocked corridor in
which we stood, showed several doorways in various states of obstruction; and
from one of them the gasoline odor-quite submerging that other hint of odor -
came with especial distinctness. As we looked more steadily, we saw that
beyond a doubt there had been a slight and recent clearing away of debris from
that particular opening. Whatever the lurking horror might be, we believed the
direct avenue toward it was now plainly manifest. I do not think anyone will
wonder that we waited an appreciable time before making any further motion.

And yet, when we did venture inside that black arch, our first impression was
one of anticlimax. For amidst the littered expanse of that sculptured Crypt - a
perfect cube with sides of about twenty feet - there remained no recent object of
instantly discernible size; so that we looked instinctively, though in vain, for a
farther doorway. In another moment, however, Danforth's sharp vision had
descried a place where the floor debris had been disturbed; and we turned on
both torches full strength. Though what we saw in that light was actually simple
and trifling, I am none the less reluctant to tell of it because of what it implied. It
was a rough leveling of the debris, upon which several small objects lay
carelessly scattered, and at one corner of which a considerable amount of
gasoline must have been spilled lately enough to leave a strong odor even at this
extreme superplateau altitude. In other words, it could not be other than a sort of
camp - a camp made by questing beings who, like us, had been turned back by
the unexpectedly choked way to the abyss.

Let me be plain. The scattered objects were, so far as substance was concerned,
all from Lake's camp; and consisted of tin cans as queerly opened as those we
had seen at that ravaged place, many spent matches, three illustrated books more
or less curiously smudged, an empty ink bottle with its pictorial and
instructional carton, a broken fountain pen, some oddly snipped fragments of fur


and tent cloth, a used electric battery with circular of directions, a folder that
came with our type of tent heater, and a sprinkling of crumpled papers. It was all
bad enough but when we smoothed out the papers and looked at what was on
them, we felt we had come to the worst. We had found certain inexplicably
blotted papers at the camp which might have prepared us, yet the effect of the
sight down there in the prehuman vaults of a nightmare city was almost too
much to bear.

A mad Gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of those found
on the greenish soapstones, just as the dots on those insane five-pointed grave
mounds might have been made; and he might conceivably have prepared rough,
hasty sketches - varying in their accuracy or lack of it - which outlined the
neighboring parts of the city and traced the way from a circularly represented
place outside our previous route - a place we identified as a great cylindrical
tower in the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed in our aerial survey - to
the present five-pointed structure and the tunnel mouth therein.

He might, I repeat, have prepared such sketches; for those before us were quite
obviously compiled, as our own had been, from late sculptures somewhere in the
glacial labyrinth, though not from the ones which we had seen and used. But
what the art-blind bungler could never have done was to execute those sketches
in a strange and assured technique perhaps superior, despite haste and
carelessness, to any of the decadent carvings from which they were taken - the
characteristic and unmistakable technique of the Old Ones themselves in the
dead city's heyday.

There are those who will say Danforth and I were utterly mad not to flee for our
lives after that; since our conclusions were now - notwithstanding their wildness

- completely fixed, and of a nature I need not even mention to those who have
read my account as far as this. Perhaps we were mad - for have I not said those
horrible peaks were mountains of madness? But I think I can detect something of
the same spirit - albeit in a less extreme form - in the men who stalk deadly
beasts through African jungles to photograph them or study their habits. Half
paralyzed with terror though we were, there was nevertheless fanned within us a
blazing flame of awe and curiosity which triumphed in the end.

Of course we did not mean to face that - or those - which we knew had been
there, but we felt that they must be gone by now. They would by this time have
found the other neighboring entrance to the abyss, and have passed within, to
whatever night-black fragments of the past might await them in the ultimate gulf

- the ultimate gulf they had never seen. Or if that entrance, too, was blocked, they
would have gone on to the north seeking another. They were, we remembered,
partly independent of light.



Looking back to that moment, I can scarcely recall just what precise form our
new emotions took - just what change of immediate objective it was that so
sharpened our sense of expectancy. We certainly did not mean to face what we
feared - yet I will not deny that we may have had a lurking, unconscious wish to
spy certain things from some hidden vantage point. Probably we had not given
up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself, though there was interposed a new goal
in the form of that great circular place shown on the crumpled sketches we had
found. We had at once recognized it as a monstrous cylindrical tower figuring in
the very earliest carvings, but appearing only as a prodigious round aperture
from above. Something about the impressiveness of its rendering, even in these
hasty diagrams, made us think that its subglacial levels must still form a feature
of peculiar importance. Perhaps it embodied architectural marvels as yet
unencountered by us. It was certainly of incredible age according to the
sculptures in which it figured - being indeed among the first things built in the
city. Its carvings, if preserved, could not but be highly significant. Moreover, it
might form a good present link with the upper world - a shorter route than the
one we were so carefully blazing, and probably that by which those others had
descended.

At any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches - which quite
perfectly confirmed our own - and start back over the indicated course to the
circular place; the course which our nameless predecessors must have traversed
twice before us. The other neighboring gate to the abyss would lie beyond that. I
need not speak of our journey - during which we continued to leave an
economical trail of paper - for it was precisely the same in kind as that by which
we had reached the cul-de-sac; except that it tended to adhere more closely to the
ground level and even descend to basement corridors. Every now and then we
could trace certain disturbing marks in the debris or litter underfoot; and after
we had passed outside the radius of the gasoline scent, we were again faintly
conscious - spasmodically - of that more hideous and more persistent scent. After
the way had branched from our former course, we sometimes gave the rays of
our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls; noting in almost every case the
well-nigh omnipresent sculptures, which indeed seem to have formed a main
aesthetic outlet for the Old Ones.

About 9:30 P.M., while traversing a long, vaulted corridor whose increasingly
glaciated floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and whose roof grew
lower as we advanced, we began to see strong daylight ahead and were able to
turn off our torch. It appeared that we were coming to the vast circular place,
and that our distance from the upper air could not be very great. The corridor
ended in an arch surprisingly low for these megalithic ruins, but we could see
much through it even before we emerged. Beyond there stretched a prodigious
round space - fully two hundred feet in diameter - strewn with debris and


containing many choked archways corresponding to the one we were about to
cross. The walls were - in available spaces - boldly sculptured into a spiral band
of heroic proportions; and displayed, despite the destructive weathering caused
by the openness of the spot, an artistic splendor far beyond anything we had
encountered before. The littered floor was quite heavily glaciated, and we
fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably lower depth.

But the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which, eluding the
archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor, wound spirally up the
stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart of those once climbing
outside the monstrous towers or ziggurats of antique Babylon. Only the rapidity
of our flight, and the perspective which confounded the descent with the tower's
inner wall, had prevented our noticing this feature from the air, and thus caused
us to seek another avenue to the subglacial level. Pabodie might have been able
to tell what sort of engineering held it in place, but Danforth and I could merely
admire and marvel. We could see mighty stone corbels and pillars here and
there, but what we saw seemed inadequate to the function performed. The thing
was excellently preserved up to the present top of the tower - a highly
remarkable circumstance in view of its exposure - and its shelter had done much
to protect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the walls.

As we stepped out into the awesome half daylight of this monstrous cylinder
bottom - fifty million years old, and without doubt the most primally ancient
structure ever to meet our eyes - we saw that the ramp- traversed sides stretched
dizzily up to a height of fully sixty feet. This, we recalled from our aerial survey,
meant an outside glaciation of some forty feet; since the yawning gulf we had
seen from the plane had been at the top of an approximately twenty-foot mound
of crumbled masonry, somewhat sheltered for three-fourths of its circumference
by the massive curving walls of a line of higher ruins. According to the
sculptures, the original tower had stood in the center of an immense circular
plaza, and had been perhaps five hundred or six hundred feet high, with tiers of
horizontal disks near the top, and a row of needlelike spires along the upper rim.
Most of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather than inward - a
fortunate happening, since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered and
the whole interior choked. As it was, the ramp showed sad battering; whilst the
choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been
recently cleared.

It took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which
those others had descended, and that this would be the logical route for our own
ascent despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere. The tower's mouth
was no farther from the foothills and our waiting plane than was the great
terraced building we had entered, and any further subglacial exploration we



might make on this trip would He in this general region. Oddly, we were still
thinking about possible later trips - even after all we had seen and guessed. Then,
as we picked our way cautiously over the debris of the great floor, there came a
sight which for the time excluded all other matters.

It was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the
ramp's lower and outward- projecting course which had hitherto been screened
from our view. There they were - the three sledges missing from Lake's camp -
shaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging along great
reaches of snowless masonry and debris, as well as much hand portage over
utterly unnavigable places. They were carefully and intelligently packed and
strapped, and contained things memorably familiar enough: the gasoline stove,
fuel cans, instrument cases, provision tins, tarpaulins obviously bulging with
books, and some bulging with less obvious contents - everything derived from
Lake's equipment.

Alter what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure prepared for
this encounter. The really great shock came when we stepped over and undid
one tarpaulin whose outlines had peculiarly disquieted us. It seems that others as
well as Lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens; for there were
two here, both stiffly frozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster
where some wounds around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with care to
prevent further damage. They were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing
dog.

X

Many people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about
the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our somber discovery, and I am
not prepared to say that we would have immediately revived such thoughts but
for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a whole new train
of speculations. We had replaced the tarpaulin over poor Gedney and were
standing in a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our
consciousness - the first sounds we had heard since descending out of the open
where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly heights. Well-
known and mundane though they were, their presence in this remote world of
death was more unexpected and unnerving than any grotesque or fabulous tones
could possibly have been - since they gave a fresh upsetting to all our notions of
cosmic harmony.

Had it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide range which
Lake's dissection report had led us to expect in those others - and which, indeed,
our overwrought fancies had been reading into every wind howl we had heard


since coining on the camp horror - it would have had a kind of helHsh congruity
with the aeon-dead region around us. A voice from other epochs belongs in a
graveyard of other epochs. As it was, however, the noise shattered all our
profoundly seated adjustments - all our tacit acceptance of the inner antarctic as a
waste utterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life. What we heard
was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of elder earth from whose
supernal toughness an age-denied polar sun had evoked a monstrous response.
Instead, it was a thing so mockingly normal and so unerringly familiarized by
our sea days off Victoria Land and our camp days at McMurdo Sound that we
shuddered to think of it here, where such things ought not to be. To be brief - it
was simply the raucous squawking of a penguin.

The muffled sound floated from subglacial recesses nearly opposite to the
corridor whence we had come - regions manifestly in the direction of that other
tunnel to the vast abyss. The presence of a living water bird in such a direction -
in a world whose surface was one of age-long and uniform lifelessness - could
lead to only one conclusion; hence our first thought was to verify the objective
reality of the sound. It was, indeed, repeated, and seemed at times to come from
more than one throat. Seeking its source, we entered an archway from which
much debris had been cleared; resuming our trail blazing - with an added paper
supply taken with curious repugnance from one of the tarpaulin bundles on the
sledges - when we left daylight behind.

As the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus, we plainly discerned some
curious, dragging tracks; and once Danforth found a distinct print of a sort
whose description would be only too superfluous. The course indicated by the
penguin cries was precisely what our map and compass prescribed as an
approach to the more northerly tunnel mouth, and we were glad to find that a
bridgeless thoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open. The
tunnel, according to the chart, ought to start from the basement of a large
pyramidal structure which we seemed vaguely to recall from our aerial survey as
remarkably well-preserved. Along our path the single torch showed a customary
profusion of carvings, but we did not pause to examine any of these.

Suddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us, and we flashed on the
second torch. It is odd how wholly this new quest had turned our minds from
earlier fears of what might lurk near. Those other ones, having left their supplies
in the great circular place, must have planned to return after their scouting trip
toward or into the abyss; yet we had now discarded all caution concerning them
as completely as if they had never existed. This white, waddling thing was fully
six feet high, yet we seemed to realize at once that it was not one of those others.
They were larger and dark, and, according to the sculptures, their motion over
land surfaces was a swift, assured matter despite the queerness of their sea-born


tentacle equipment. But to say that the white thing did not profoundly frighten
us would be vain. We were indeed clutched for an instant by primitive dread
almost sharper than the worst of our reasoned fears regarding those others. Then
came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our
left to join two others of its kind which had summoned it in raucous tones. For it
was only a penguin - albeit of a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest
of the known king penguins, and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual
eyelessness.

When we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our torches
on the indifferent and unheeding group of three, we saw that they were all
eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species. Their size reminded
us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the Old Ones' sculptures, and it
did not take us long to conclude that they were descended from the same stock-
undoubtedly surviving through a retreat to some warmer inner region whose
perpetual blackness had destroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes
to mere useless slits. That their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought, was
not for a moment to be doubted; and this evidence of the gulf's continued
warmth and habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing
fancies.

We wondered, too, what had caused these three birds to venture out of their
usual domain. The state and silence of the great dead city made it clear that it
had at no time been an habitual seasonal rookery, whilst the manifest
indifference of the trio to our presence made it seem odd that any passing party
of those others should have startled them. Was it possible that those others had
taken some aggressive action or t- ried to increase their meat supply? We
doubted whether that pungent odor which the dogs had hated could cause an
equal antipathy in these penguins, since their ancestors had obviously lived on
excellent terms with the Old Ones - an amicable relationship which must have
survived in the abyss below as long as any of the Old Ones remained. Regretting
- in a flare-up of the old spirit of pure science - that we could not photograph
these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them to their squawking and pushed
on toward the abyss whose openness was now so positively proved to us, and
whose exact direction occasional penguin tracks made clear.

Not long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and peculiarly
sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were approaching the tunnel
mouth at last. We had passed two more penguins, and heard others immediately
ahead. Then the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us gasp
involuntarily - a perfect inverted hemisphere, obviously deep underground; fully
a hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high, with low archways opening
around all parts of the circumference but one, and that one yawning cavernously


with a black, arched aperture which broke the symmetry of the vauh to a height
of nearly fifteen feet. It was the entrance to the great abyss.

In this vast hemisphere, whose concave roof was impressively though
decadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome, a few albino
penguins waddled - aliens there, but indifferent and unseeing. The black tunnel
yawned indefinitely off at a steep, descending grade, its aperture adorned with
grotesquely chiseled jambs and lintel. From that cryptical mouth we fancied a
current of slightly warmer air, and perhaps even a suspicion of vapor proceeded;
and we wondered what living entities other than penguins the limitless void
below, and the contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains,
might conceal. We wondered, too, whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at
first suspected by poor Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves perceived
around the rampart-crowned peak, might not be caused by the tortuous-
channeled rising of some such vapor from the unfathomed regions of earth's
core.

Entering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was - at least at the start - about
fifteen feet each way - sides, floor, and arched roof composed of the usual
megalithic masonry. The sides were sparsely decorated with cartouches of
conventional designs in a late, decadent style; and all the construction and
carving were marvelously well-preserved. The floor was quite clear, except for a
slight detritus bearing outgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of these
others. The farther one advanced, the warmer it became; so that we were soon
unbuttoning our heavy garments. We wondered whether there were any actually
igneous manifestations below, and whether the waters of that sunless sea were
hot. Alter a short distance the masonry gave place to solid rock, though the
tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same aspect of carved
regularity. Occasionally its varying grade became so steep that grooves were cut
in the floor. Several times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not
recorded in our diagrams; none of them such as to complicate the problem of our
return, and all of them welcome as possible refuges in case we met unwelcome
entities on their way back from the abyss. The nameless scent of such things was
very distinct. Doubtless it was suicidally foolish to venture into that tunnel under
the known conditions, but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain
persons than most suspect - indeed, it was just such a lure which had brought us
to this unearthly polar waste in the first place. We saw several penguins as we
passed along, and speculated on the distance we would have to traverse. The
carvings had led us to expect a steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss,
but our previous wanderings had shown us that matters of scale were not wholly
to be depended on.



Alter about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly accentuated,
and we kept very careful track of the various lateral openings we passed. There
was no visible vapor as at the mouth, but this was doubtless due to the lack of
contrasting cooler air. The temperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not
surprised to come upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It
was composed of furs and tent cloth taken from Lake's camp, and we did not
pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been slashed. Slightly
beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and number of the
side galleries, and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the
higher foothills must now have been reached. The nameless scent was now
curiously mixed with another and scarcely less offensive odor - of what nature
we could not guess, though we thought of decaying organisms and perhaps
unknown subterranean fungi. Then came a startling expansion of the tunnel for
which the carvings had not prepared us - a broadening and rising into a lofty,
natural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor, some seventy-five feet long
and fifty broad, and with many immense side passages leading away into
cryptical darkness.

Though this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both torches
suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls
between adjacent honey combings. The walls were rough, and the high, vaulted
roof was thick with stalactites; but the solid rock floor had been smoothed off,
and was free from all debris, detritus, or even dust to a positively abnormal
extent. Except for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of the
floors of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the singularity of the
condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling. The curious new fetor which had
supplemented the nameless scent was excessively pungent here; so much so that
it destroyed all trace of the other. Something about this whole place, with its
polished and almost glistening floor, struck us as more vaguely baffling and
horrible than any of the monstrous things we had previously encountered.

The regularity of the passage immediately ahead, as well as the larger proportion
of penguin-droppings there, prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst
this plethora of equally great cave mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume
our paper trailblazing if any further complexity should develop; for dust tracks,
of course, could no longer be expected. Upon resuming our direct progress we
cast a beam of torchlight over the tunnel walls - and stopped short in amazement
at the supremely radical change which had come over the carvings in this part of
the passage. We realized, of course, the great decadence of the Old Ones'
sculpture at the time of the tunneling, and had indeed noticed the inferior
workmanship of the arabesques in the stretches behind us. But now, in this
deeper section beyond the cavern, there was a sudden difference wholly
transcending explanation - a difference in basic nature as well as in mere quality.


and involving so profound and calamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in
the hitherto observed rate of decline could have led one to expect it.

This new and degenerate work was coarse, bold, and wholly lacking in delicacy
of detail. It was countersunk with exaggerated depth in bands following the
same general line as the sparse car-touches of the earlier sections, but the height
of the reliefs did not reach the level of the general surface. Danforth had the idea
that it was a second carving - a sort of palimpsest formed after the obliteration of
a previous design. In nature it was wholly decorative and conventional, and
consisted of crude spirals and angles roughly following the quintile
mathematical tradition of the Old Ones, yet seemingly more like a parody than a
perpetuation of that tradition. We could not get it out of our minds that some
subtly but profoundly alien element had been added to the aesthetic feeling
behind the technique - an alien element, Danforth guessed, that was responsible
for the laborious substitution. It was like, yet disturbingly unlike, what we had
come to recognize as the Old Ones' art; and I was persistently reminded of such
hybrid things as the ungainly Palmyrene sculptures fashioned in the Roman
manner. That others had recently noticed this belt of carving was hinted by the
presence of a used flashlight battery on the floor in front of one of the most
characteristic cartouches.

Since we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we resumed
our advance after a cursory look; though frequently casting beams over the walls
to see if any further decorative changes developed. Nothing of the sort was
perceived, though the carvings were in places rather sparse because of the
numerous mouths of smooth-floored lateral tunnels. We saw and heard fewer
penguins, but thought we caught a vague suspicion of an infinitely distant
chorus of them somewhere deep within the earth. The new and inexplicable odor
was abominably strong, and we could detect scarcely a sign of that other
nameless scent. Puffs of visible vapor ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in
temperature, and the relative nearness of the sunless sea cliffs of the great abyss.
Then, quite unexpectedly, we saw certain obstructions on the polished floor
ahead - obstructions which were quite definitely not penguins - and turned on
our second torch after making sure that the objects were quite stationary.

XI

Still another time have I come to a place where it is very difficult to proceed. I
ought to be hardened by this stage; but there are some experiences and
intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing, and leave only such an
added sensitiveness that memory reinspires all the original horror. We saw, as I
have said, certain obstructions on the polished floor ahead; and I may add that
our nostrils were assailed almost simultaneously by a very curious intensification


of the strange prevailing fetor, now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench
of those others which had gone before. The light of the second torch left no doubt
of what the obstructions were, and we dared approach them only because we
could see, even from a distance, that they were quite as past all harming power
as had been the six similar specimens unearthed from the monstrous star-
mounded graves at poor Lake's camp.

They were, indeed, as lacking - in completeness as most of those we had
unearthed - though it grew plain from the thick, dark green pool gathering
around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely greater recency. There
seemed to be only four of them, whereas Lake's bulletins would have suggested
no less than eight as forming the group which had preceded us. To find them in
this state was wholly unexpected, and we wondered what sort of monstrous
struggle had occurred down here in the dark.

Penguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks, and our ears
now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond. Had those others
disturbed such a place and aroused murderous pursuit? The obstructions did not
suggest it, for penguins' beaks against the tough tissues Lake had dissected could
hardly account for the terrible damage our approaching glance was beginning to
make out. Besides, the huge blind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly
peaceful.

Had there, then, been a struggle among those others, and were the absent four
responsible? If so, where were they? Were they close at hand and likely to form
an immediate menace to us? We glanced anxiously at some of the smooth-
floored lateral passages as we continued our slow and frankly reluctant
approach. Whatever the conflict was, it had clearly been that which had
frightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering. It must, then, have
arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable gulf beyond, since there
were no signs that any birds had normally dwelt here. Perhaps, we reflected,
there had been a hideous running fight, with the weaker party seeking to get
back to the cached sledges when their pursuers finished them. One could picture
the demoniac fray between namelessly monstrous entities as it surged out of the
black abyss with great clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying
ahead.

I say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions slowly
and reluctantly. Would to Heaven we had never approached them at all, but had
run back at top speed out of that blasphemous tunnel with the greasily smooth
floors and the degenerate murals aping and mocking the things they had
superseded-run back, before we had seen what we did see, and before our minds
were burned with something which will never let us breathe easily again!


Both of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects, so that we soon reaHzed
the dominant factor in their incompleteness. Mauled, compressed, twisted, and
ruptured as they were, their chief common injury was total decapitation. From
each one the tentacled starfish head had been removed; and as we drew near we
saw that the manner of removal looked more like some hellish tearing or suction
than like any ordinary form of cleavage. Their noisome dark-green ichor formed
a large, spreading pOOl; but its stench was half overshadowed by the newer and
stranger stench, here more pungent than at any other point along our route. Only
when we had come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we trace that
second, unexplainable fetor to any immediate source - and the instant we did so
Danforth, remembering certain very vivid sculptures of the Old Ones' history in
the Permian Age one hundred and fifty million years ago, gave vent to a nerve-
tortured cry which echoed hysterically through that vaulted and archaic passage
with the evil, palimpsest carvings.

I came only just short of echoing his cry myself; for I had seen those primal
sculptures, too, and had shudderingly admired the way the nameless artist had
suggested that hideous slime coating found on certain incomplete and prostrate
Old Ones - those whom the frightful Shoggoths had characteristically slain and
sucked to a ghastly headlessness in the great war of resubjugation. They were
infamous, nightmare sculptures even when telling of age-old, bygone things; for
Shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by human beings or portrayed by
any beings. The mad author of the Necronomicon had nervously tried to swear
that none had been bred on this planet, and that only drugged dreamers had
even conceived them. Formless protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms
and organs and processes - viscous agglutinations of bubbling cells - rubbery
fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic and ductile - slaves of suggestion, builders
of cities - more and more sullen, more and more intelligent, more and more
amphibious, more and more imitative! Great God! What madness made even
those blasphemous Old Ones willing to use and carve such things?

And now, when Danforth and I saw the freshly glistening and reflectively
iridescent black slime which clung thickly to those headless bodies and stank
obscenely with that new, unknown odor whose cause only a diseased fancy
could envisage - clung to those bodies and sparkled less voluminously on a
smooth part of the accursedly resculptured wall in a series of grouped dots - we
understood the quality of cosmic fear to its uttermost depths. It was not fear of
those four missing others - for all too well did we suspect they would do no
harm again. Poor devils! Alter all, they were not evil things of their kind. They
were the men of another age and another order of being. Nature had played a
hellish jest on them - as it will on any others that human madness, callousness, or
cruelty may hereafter dig up in that hideously dead or sleeping polar waste - and
this was their tragic homecoming. They had not been even savages-for what


indeed had they done? That awful awakening in the cold of an unknown epoch -
perhaps an attack by the furry, frantically barking quadrupeds, and a dazed
defense against them and the equally frantic white simians with the queer
wrappings and paraphernalia ... poor Lake, poor Gedney... and poor Old Ones!
Scientists to the last - what had they done that we would not have done in their
place? God, what intelligence and persistence! What a facing of the incredible,
just as those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things only a little less
incredible! Radiates, vegetables, monstrosities, star spawn - whatever they had
been, they were men!

They had crossed the icy peaks on whose templed slopes they had once
worshipped and roamed among the tree ferns. They had found their dead city
brooding under its curse, and had read its carven latter days as we had done.
They had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled depths of blackness they
had never seen - and what had they found? All this flashed in unison through
the thoughts of Danforth and me as we looked from those headless, slime-coated
shapes to the loathsome palimpsest sculptures and the diabolical dot groups of
fresh slime on the wall beside them - looked and understood what must have
triumphed and survived down there in the Cyclopean water city of that nighted,
penguin-fringed abyss, whence even now a sinister curling mist had begun to
belch pallidly as if in answer to Danforth's hysterical scream.

The shock of recognizing that monstrous slime and headlessness had frozen us
into mute, motionless statues, and it is only through later conversations that we
have learned of the complete identity of our thoughts at that moment. It seemed
aeons that we stood there, but actually it could not have been more than ten or
fifteen seconds. That hateful, pallid mist curled forward as if veritably driven by
some remoter advancing bulk-and then came a sound which upset much of what
we had just decided, and in so doing broke the spell and enabled us to run like
mad past squawking, confused penguins over our former trail back to the city,
along ice-sunken megalithic corridors to the great open circle, and up that
archaic spiral ramp in a frenzied, automatic plunge for the sane outer air and
light of day.

The new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided; because it
was what poor Lake's dissection had led us to attribute to those we had judged
dead. It was, Danforth later told me, precisely what he had caught in infinitely
muffled form when at that spot beyond the alley corner above the glacial level;
and it certainly had a shocking resemblance to the wind pipings we had both
heard around the lofty mountain caves. At the risk of seeming puerile I will add
another thing, too, if only because of the surprising way Danforth's impressions
chimed with mine. Of course common reading is what prepared us both to make
the interpretation, though Danforth has hinted at queer notions about


unsuspected and forbidden sources to which Poe may have had access when
writing his Arthur Gordon Pym a century ago. It will be remembered that in that
fantastic tale there is a word of unknown but terrible and prodigious significance
connected with the antarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic spectrally
snowy birds of that malign region's core. "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" That, I may admit,
is exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden sound behind the
advancing white mist-that insidious musical piping over a singularly wide
range.

We were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been uttered, though we
knew that the swiftness of the Old Ones would enable any scream-roused and
pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake us in a moment if it really wished
to do so. We had a vague hope, however, that nonaggressive conduct and a
display of kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case of capture,
if only from scientific curiosity. Alter all, if such an one had nothing to fear for
itself, it would have no motive in harming us. Concealment being futile at this
juncture, we used our torch for a running glance behind, and perceived that the
mist was thinning. Would we see, at last, a complete and living specimen of
those others? Again came that insidious musical piping- "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!"
Then, noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer, it occurred to us that
the entity might be wounded. We could take no chances, however, since it was
very obviously approaching in answer to Danforth's scream, rather than in flight
from any other entity. The timing was too close to admit of doubt. Of the
whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable nightmare - that fetid,
unglimpsed mountain of slime-spewing protoplasm whose race had conquered
the abyss and sent land pioneers to recarve and squirm through the burrows of
the hills - we could form no guess; and it cost us a genuine pang to leave this
probably crippled Old One-perhaps a lone survivor - to the peril of recapture
and a nameless fate.

Thank Heaven we did not slacken our run. The curling mist had thickened again,
and was driving ahead with increased speed; whilst the straying penguins in our
rear were squawking and screaming and displaying signs of a panic really
surprising in view of their relatively minor confusion when we had passed them.
Once more came that sinister, wide-ranged piping - "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" We had
been wrong. The thing was not wounded, but had merely paused on
encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the hellish slime inscription
above them. We could never know what that demon message was - but those
burials at Lake's camp had shown how much importance the beings attached to
their dead. Our recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open
cavern where various ways converged, and we were glad to be leaving those
morbid palimpsest sculptures - almost felt even when scarcely seen-behind.
Another thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the possibility of



losing our pursuer at this bewildering focus of large galleries. There were several
of the blind albino penguins in the open space, and it seemed clear that their fear
of the oncoming entity was extreme to the point of unaccountability. If at that
point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of traveling need, keeping it
strictly in front of us, the frightened squawking motions of the huge birds in the
mist might muffle our footfalls, screen our true course, and somehow set up a
false lead. Amidst the churning, spiraling fog, the littered and unglistening floor
of the main tunnel beyond this point, as differing from the other morbidly
polished burrows, could hardly form a highly distinguishing feature; even, so far
as we could conjecture, for those indicated special senses which made the Old
Ones partly, though imperfectly, independent of light in emergencies. In fact, we
were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves in our haste. For we
had, of course, decided to keep straight on toward the dead city; since the
consequences of loss in those unknown foothill honeycombings would be
unthinkable.

The fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the thing did take
a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on the right one. The penguins
alone could not have saved us, but in conjunction with the mist they seem to
have done so. Only a benign fate kept the curling vapors thick enough at the
right moment, for they were constantly shifting and threatening to vanish.
Indeed, they did lift for a second just before we emerged from the nauseously
resculptured tunnel into the cave; so that we actually caught one first and only
half glimpse of the oncoming entity as we cast a final, desperately fearful glance
backward before dimming the torch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of
dodging pursuit. If the fate which screened us was benign, that which gave us
the half glimpse was infinitely the opposite; for to that flash of semivision can be
traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted us.

Our exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the
immemorial instinct of the pursued to gauge the nature and course of its
pursuer; or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a subconscious
question raised by one of our senses. In the midst of our flight, with all our
faculties centered on the problem of escape, we were in no condition to observe
and analyze details; yet even so, our latent brain cells must have wondered at the
message brought them by our nostrils. Alterward we realized what it was-that
our retreat from the fetid slime coating on those headless obstructions, and the
coincident approach of the pursuing entity, had not brought us the exchange of
stenches which logic called for. In the neighborhood of the prostrate things that
new and lately unexplainable fetor had been wholly dominant; but by this time it
ought to have largely given place to the nameless stench associated with those
others. This it had not done - for instead, the newer and less bearable smell was


now virtually undiluted, and growing more and more poisonously insistent each
second.

So we glanced back simultaneously, it would appear; though no doubt the
incipient motion of one prompted the imitation of the other. As we did so we
flashed both torches full strength at the momentarily thinned mist; either from
sheer primitive anxiety to see all we could, or in a less primitive but equally
unconscious effort to dazzle the entity before we dimmed our light and dodged
among the penguins of the labyrinth center ahead. Unhappy act! Not Orpheus
himself, or Lot's wife, paid much more dearly for a backward glance. And again
came that shocking, wide-ranged piping - "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!"

I might as well be frank - even if I cannot bear to be quite direct - in stating what
we saw; though at the time we felt that it was not to be admitted even to each
other. The words reaching the reader can never even suggest the awfulness of
the sight itself. It crippled our consciousness so completely that I wonder we had
the residual sense to dim our torches as planned, and to strike the right tunnel
toward the dead city. Instinct alone must have carried us through - perhaps
better than reason could have done; though if that was what saved us, we paid a
high price. Of reason we certainly had little enough left.

Danforth was totally unstrung, and the first thing I remember of the rest of the
journey was hearing him lightheadedly chant an hysterical formula in which I
alone of mankind could have found anything but insane irrelevance. It
reverberated in falsetto echoes among the squawks of the penguins; reverberated
through the vaultings ahead, and-thank God-through the now empty vaultings
behind. He could not have begun it at once - else we would not have been alive
and blindly racing. I shudder to think of what a shade of difference in his
nervous reactions might have brought.

"South Station Under - Washington Under - Park Street Under-Kendall - Central
- Harvard - " The poor fellow was chanting the familiar stations of the Boston-
Cambridge tunnel that burrowed through our peaceful native soil thousands of
miles away in New England, yet to me the ritual had neither irrelevance nor
home feeling. It had only horror, because I knew unerringly the monstrous,
nefandous analogy that had suggested it. We had expected, upon looking back,
to see a terrible and incredible moving entity if the mists were thin enough; but
of that entity we had formed a clear idea. What we did see - for the mists were
indeed all too malignly thinned - was something altogether different, and
immeasurably more hideous and detestable. It was the utter, objective
embodiment of the fantastic novelist's "thing that should not be"; and its nearest
comprehensible analogue is a vast, onrushing subway train as one sees it from a
station platform - the great black front looming colossally out of infinite


subterranean distance, constellated with strangely colored lights and filling the
prodigious burrow as a piston fills a cylinder.

But we were not on a station platform. We were on the track ahead as the
nightmare, plastic column of fetid black iridescence oozed tightly onward
through its fifteen-foot sinus, gathering unholy speed and driving before it a
spiral, rethickening cloud of the pallid abyss vapor. It was a terrible,
indescribable thing vaster than any subway train - a shapeless congeries of
protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes
forming and un-forming as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnel-filling
front that bore down upon us, crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over
the glistening floor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter. Still
came that eldritch, mocking cry- "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" and at last we remembered
that the demoniac Shoggoths - given life, thought, and plastic organ patterns
solely by the Old Ones, and having no language save that which the dot groups
expressed - had likewise no voice save the imitated accents of their bygone
masters.

XII

Danforth and I have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured
hemisphere and of threading our back trail through the Cyclopean rooms and
corridors of the dead city; yet these are purely dream fragments involving no
memory of volition, details, or physical exertion. It was as if we floated in a
nebulous world or dimension without time, causation, or orientation. The gray
half-daylight of the vast circular space sobered us somewhat; but we did not go
near those cached sledges or look again at poor Gedney and the dog. They have a
strange and titanic mausoleum, and I hope the end of this planet will find them
still undisturbed.

It was while struggling up the colossal spiral incline that we first felt the terrible
fatigue and short breath which our race through the thin plateau air had
produced; but not even fear of collapse could make us pause before reaching the
normal outer realm of sun and sky. There was something vaguely appropriate
about our departure from those buried epochs; for as we wound our panting
way up the sixty-foot cylinder of primal masonry, we glimpsed beside us a
continuous procession of heroic sculptures in the dead race's early and
undecayed technique - a farewell from the Old Ones, written fifty million years
ago.

Finally scrambling out at the top, we found ourselves on a great mound of
tumbled blocks, with the curved walls of higher stonework rising westward, and
the brooding peaks of the great mountains showing beyond the more crumbled

structures toward the east. The low antarctic sun of midnight peered redly from
the southern horizon through rifts in the jagged ruins, and the terrible age and
deadness of the nightmare city seemed all the starker by contrast with such
relatively known and accustomed things as the features of the polar landscape.
The sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous ice-vapors, and
the cold clutched at our vitals. Wearily resting the outfit-bags to which we had
instinctively clung throughout our desperate flight, we rebuttoned our heavy
garments for the stumbling climb down the mound and the walk through the
aeon-old stone maze to the foothills where our aeroplane waited. Of what had
set us fleeing from that darkness of earth's secret and archaic gulfs we said
nothing at all.

In less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the foothills-the
probable ancient terrace - by which we had descended, and could see the dark
bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse ruins on the rising slope ahead.
Halfway uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathing spell, and
turned to look again at the fantastic tangle of incredible stone shapes below us-
once more outlined mystically against an unknown west. As we did so we saw
that the sky beyond had lost its morning haziness; the restless ice-vapors having
moved up to the zenith, where their mocking outlines seemed on the point of
settling into some bizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or
conclusive.

There now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind the grotesque city
a dim, elfin line of pinnacled violet whose needle-pointed heights loomed
dreamlike against the beckoning rose color of the western sky. Up toward this
shimmering rim sloped the ancient table-land, the depressed course of the
bygone river traversing it as an irregular ribbon of shadow. For a second we
gasped in admiration of the scene's unearthly cosmic beauty, and then vague
horror began to creep into our souls. For this far violet line could be nothing else
than the terrible mountains of the forbidden land - highest of earth's peaks and
focus of earth's evil; harborers of nameless horrors and Archaean secrets;
shunned and prayed to by those who feared to carve their meaning; untrodden
by any living thing on earth, but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending
strange beams across the plains in the polar night - beyond doubt the unknown
archetype of that dreaded Kadath in the Cold Waste beyond abhorrent Leng,
whereof primal legends hint evasively.

If the sculptured maps and pictures in that prehuman city had told truly, these
cryptic violet mountains could not be much less than three hundred miles away;
yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin essence appear above that remote
and snowy rim, like the serrated edge of a monstrous alien planet about to rise
into unaccustomed heavens. Their height, then, must have been tremendous


beyond all comparison - carrying them up into tenuous atmospheric strata
peopled only by such gaseous wraiths as rash flyers have barely lived to whisper
of after unexplainable falls. Looking at them, I thought nervously of certain
sculptured hints of what the great bygone river had washed down into the city
from their accursed slopes - and wondered how much sense and how much folly
had lain in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them so reticently. I recalled
how their northerly end must come near the coast at Queen Mary Land, where
even at that moment Sir Douglas Mawson's expedition was doubtless working
less than a thousand miles away; and hoped that no evil fate would give Sir
Douglas and his men a glimpse of what might lie beyond the protecting coastal
range. Such thoughts formed a measure of my overwrought condition at the time
- and Danforth seemed to be even worse.

Yet long before we had passed the great star-shaped ruin and reached our plane,
our fears had become transferred to the lesser but vast-enough range whose
recrossing lay ahead of us. From these foothills the black, ruin-crusted slopes
reared up starkly and hideously against the east, again reminding us of those
strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich; and when we thought of the
frightful amorphous entities that might have pushed their fetidly squirming way
even to the topmost hollow pinnacles, we could not face without panic the
prospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave mouths where the
wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range. To make
matters worse, we saw distinct traces of local mist around several of the
summits-as poor Lake must have done when he made that early mistake about
volcanism - and thought shiveringly of that kindred mist from which we had just
escaped; of that, and of the blasphemous, horror-fostering abyss whence all such
vapors came.

All was well with the plane, and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying furs.
Danforth got the engine started without trouble, and we made a very smooth
take-off over the nightmare city. Below us the primal Cyclopean masonry spread
out as it had done when first we saw it, and we began rising and turning to test
the wind for our crossing through the pass. At a very high level there must have
been great disturbance, since the ice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all
sorts of fantastic things; but at twenty-four thousand feet, the height we needed
for the pass, we found navigation quite practicable. As we drew close to the
jutting peaks the wind's strange piping again became manifest, and I could see
Danforth's hands trembling at the controls. Rank amateur that I was, I thought at
that moment that I might be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous
crossing between pinnacles; and when I made motions to change seats and take
over his duties he did not protest. I tried to keep all my skill and self-possession
about me, and stared at the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the
pass-resolutely refusing to pay attention to the puffs of mountain-top vapor, and


wishing that I had wax-stopped ears hke Ulysses' men off the Siren's coast to
keep that disturbing windpiping from my consciousness.

But Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous nervous
pitch, could not keep quiet. I felt him turning and wriggling about as he looked
back at the terrible receding city, ahead at the cave- riddled, cube-barnacled
peaks, sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy, rampart-strewn foothills, and upward
at the seething, grotesquely clouded sky. It was then, just as I was trying to steer
safely through the pass, that his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster by
shattering my tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the
controls for a moment. A second afterward my resolution triumphed and we
made the crossing safely - yet I am afraid that Danforth will never be -the same
again.

I have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream
out so insanely-a horror which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly responsible for his
present breakdown. We had snatches of shouted conversation above the wind's
piping and the engine's buzzing as we reached the safe side of the range and
swooped slowly down toward the camp, but that had mostly to do with the
pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city.
Certain things, we had agreed, were not for people to know and discuss lightly-
and I would not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that
Starkweather-Moore Expedition, and others, at any cost. It is absolutely
necessary, for the peace and safety of mankind, that some of earth's dark, dead
corners and unplumbed depths be let alone; lest sleeping abnormalities wake to
resurgent life, and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out
of their black lairs to newer and wider conquests.

All that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage. It was not,
he declares, anything connected with the cubes and caves of those echoing,
vaporous, wormily-honeycombed mountains of madness which we crossed; but
a single fantastic, demoniac glimpse, among the churning zenith clouds, of what
lay back of those other violet westward mountains which the Old Ones had
shunned and feared. It is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born
of the previous stresses we had passed through, and of the actual though
unrecognized mirage of the dead transmontane city experienced near Lake's
camp the day before; but it was so real to Danforth that he suffers from it still.

He has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things about
"The black pit," "the carven rim," "the protoShoggoths," "the windowless solids
with five dimensions," "the nameless cylinder," "the elder Pharos," "Yog-
Sothoth," "the primal white jelly," "the color out of space," "the wings," "the
eyes in darkness," "the moon-ladder," "the original, the eternal, the undying,"


and other bizarre conceptions; but when he is fully himself he repudiates all this
and attributes it to his curious and macabre reading of earlier years. Danforth,
indeed, is known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely
through that worm-riddled copy of the Necronomicon kept under lock and key
in the college library.

The higher sky, as we crossed the range, was surely vaporous and disturbed
enough; and although I did not see the zenith, I can well imagine that its swirls
of ice dust may have taken strange forms. Imagination, knowing how vividly
distant scenes can sometimes be reflected, refracted, and magnified by such
layers of restless cloud, might easily have supplied the rest - and, of course,
Danforth did not hint any of these specific horrors till after his memory had had
a chance to draw on his bygone reading. He could never have seen so much in
one instantaneous glance.

At the time, his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single, mad word of
all too obvious source: "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!"



Dagon

Written July 1917

Published November 1919 in The Vagrant, No. 11, 23-29.

I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight I shall be
no more. Penniless, and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone, makes
life endurable, I can bear the torture no longer; and shall cast myself from this
garret window into the squalid street below. Do not think from my slavery to
morphine that I am a weakling or a degenerate. When you have read these
hastily scrawled pages you may guess, though never fully realise, why it is that I
must have forgetfulness or death.

It was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the broad Pacific that
the packet of which I was supercargo fell a victim to the German sea-raider. The
great war was then at its very beginning, and the ocean forces of the Hun had not
completely sunk to their later degradation; so that our vessel was made a
legitimate prize, whilst we of her crew were treated with all the fairness and
consideration due us as naval prisoners. So liberal, indeed, was the discipline of
our captors, that five days after we were taken I managed to escape alone in a
small boat with water and provisions for a good length of time.

When I finally found myself adrift and free, I had but little idea of my
surroundings. Never a competent navigator, I could only guess vaguely by the
sun and stars that I was somewhat south of the equator. Of the longitude I knew
nothing, and no island or coastline was in sight. The weather kept fair, and for
uncounted days I drifted aimlessly beneath the scorching sun; waiting either for
some passing ship, or to be cast on the shores of some habitable land. But neither
ship nor land appeared, and I began to despair in my solitude upon the heaving
vastness of unbroken blue.

The change happened whilst I slept. Its details I shall never know; for my
slumber, though troubled and dream-infested, was continuous. When at last I
awakened, it was to discover myself half sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish
black mire which extended about me in monotonous undulations as far as I
could see, and in which my boat lay grounded some distance away.

Though one might well imagine that my first sensation would be of wonder at so
prodigious and unexpected a transformation of scenery, I was in reality more
horrified than astonished; for there was in the air and in the rotting soil a sinister
quality which chilled me to the very core. The region was putrid with the


carcasses of decaying fish, and of other less describable things which I saw
protruding from the nasty mud of the unending plain. Perhaps I should not hope
to convey in mere words the unutterable hideousness that can dwell in absolute
silence and barren immensity. There was nothing within hearing, and nothing in
sight save a vast reach of black slime; yet the very completeness of the stillness
and the homogeneity of the landscape oppressed me with a nauseating fear.

The sun was blazing down from a sky which seemed to me almost black in its
cloudless cruelty; as though reflecting the inky marsh beneath my feet. As I
crawled into the stranded boat I realised that only one theory could explain my
position. Through some unprecedented volcanic upheaval, a portion of the ocean
floor must have been thrown to the surface, exposing regions which for
innumerable millions of years had lain hidden under unfathomable watery
depths. So great was the extent of the new land which had risen beneath me, that
I could not detect the faintest noise of the surging ocean, strain my ears as I
might. Nor were there any sea-fowl to prey upon the dead things.

For several hours I sat thinking or brooding in the boat, which lay upon its side
and afforded a slight shade as the sun moved across the heavens. As the day
progressed, the ground lost some of its stickiness, and seemed likely to dry
sufficiently for travelling purposes in a short time. That night I slept but little,
and the next day I made for myself a pack containing food and water,
preparatory to an overland journey in search of the vanished sea and possible
rescue.

On the third morning I found the soil dry enough to walk upon with ease. The
odour of the fish was maddening; but I was too much concerned with graver
things to mind so slight an evil, and set out boldly for an unknown goal. All day
I forged steadily westward, guided by a far-away hummock which rose higher
than any other elevation on the rolling desert. That night I encamped, and on the
following day still travelled toward the hummock, though that object seemed
scarcely nearer than when I had first espied it. By the fourth evening I attained
the base of the mound, which turned out to be much higher than it had appeared
from a distance, an intervening valley setting it out in sharper relief from the
general surface. Too weary to ascend, I slept in the shadow of the hill.

I know not why my dreams were so wild that night; but ere the waning and
fantastically gibbous moon had risen far above the eastern plain, I was awake in
a cold perspiration, determined to sleep no more. Such visions as I had
experienced were too much for me to endure again. And in the glow of the moon
I saw how unwise I had been to travel by day. Without the glare of the parching
sun, my journey would have cost me less energy; indeed, I now felt quite able to


perform the ascent which had deterred me at sunset. Picking up my pack, I
started for the crest of the eminence.

I have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolHng plain was a source of
vague horror to me; but I think my horror was greater when I gained the summit
of the mound and looked down the other side into an immeasurable pit or
canyon, whose black recesses the moon had not yet soared high enough to
illumine. I felt myself on the edge of the world, peering over the rim into a
fathomless chaos of eternal night. Through my terror ran curious reminiscences
of Paradise Lost, and Satan's hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of
darkness.

As the moon climbed higher in the sky, I began to see that the slopes of the valley
were not quite so perpendicular as I had imagined. Ledges and outcroppings of
rock afforded fairly easy footholds for a descent, whilst after a drop of a few
hundred feet, the declivity became very gradual. Urged on by an impulse which
I cannot definitely analyse, I scrambled with difficulty down the rocks and stood
on the gentler slope beneath, gazing into the Stygian deeps where no light had
yet penetrated.

All at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular object on the
opposite slope, which rose steeply about a hundred yards ahead of me; an object
that gleamed whitely in the newly bestowed rays of the ascending moon. That it
was merely a gigantic piece of stone, I soon assured myself; but I was conscious
of a distinct impression that its contour and position were not altogether the
work of Nature. A closer scrutiny filled me with sensations I cannot express; for
despite its enormous magnitude, and its position in an abyss which had yawned
at the bottom of the sea since the world was young, I perceived beyond a doubt
that the strange object was a well-shaped monolith whose massive bulk had
known the workmanship and perhaps the worship of living and thinking
creatures.

Dazed and frightened, yet not without a certain thrill of the scientist's or
archaeologist's delight, I examined my surroundings more closely. The moon,
now near the zenith, shone weirdly and vividly above the towering steeps that
hemmed in the chasm, and revealed the fact that a far-flung body of water
flowed at the bottom, winding out of sight in both directions, and almost lapping
my feet as I stood on the slope. Across the chasm, the wavelets washed the base
of the Cyclopean monolith, on whose surface I could now trace both inscriptions
and crude sculptures. The writing was in a system of hieroglyphics unknown to
me, and unlike anything I had ever seen in books, consisting for the most part of
conventionalised aquatic symbols such as fishes, eels, octopi, crustaceans,
molluscs, whales and the like. Several characters obviously represented marine


things which are unknown to the modern world, but whose decomposing forms
I had observed on the ocean-risen plain.

It was the pictorial carving, however, that did most to hold me spellbound.
Plainly visible across the intervening water on account of their enormous size
was an array of bas-reliefs whose subjects would have excited the envy of a Dore.
I think that these things were supposed to depict men — at least, a certain sort of
men; though the creatures were shown disporting like fishes in the waters of
some marine grotto, or paying homage at some monolithic shrine which
appeared to be under the waves as well. Of their faces and forms I dare not speak
in detail, for the mere remembrance makes me grow faint. Grotesque beyond the
imagination of a Poe or a Bulwer, they were damnably human in general outline
despite webbed hands and feet, shockingly wide and flabby lips, glassy, bulging
eyes, and other features less pleasant to recall. Curiously enough, they seemed to
have been chiselled badly out of proportion with their scenic background; for
one of the creatures was shown in the act of killing a whale represented as but
little larger than himself. I remarked, as I say, their grotesqueness and strange
size; but in a moment decided that they were merely the imaginary gods of some
primitive fishing or seafaring tribe; some tribe whose last descendant had
perished eras before the first ancestor of the Piltdown or Neanderthal Man was
born. Awestruck at this unexpected glimpse into a past beyond the conception of
the most daring anthropologist, I stood musing whilst the moon cast queer
reflections on the silent channel before me.

Then suddenly I saw it. With only a slight churning to mark its rise to the
surface, the thing slid into view above the dark waters. Vast, Polyphemus-like,
and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the
monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its
hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds. I think I went mad
then.

Of my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff, and of my delirious journey back to
the stranded boat, I remember little. I believe I sang a great deal, and laughed
oddly when I was unable to sing. I have indistinct recollections of a great storm
some time after I reached the boat; at any rate, I knew that I heard peals of
thunder and other tones which Nature utters only in her wildest moods.

When I came out of the shadows I was in a San Francisco hospital; brought
thither by the captain of the American ship which had picked up my boat in mid-
ocean. In my delirium I had said much, but found that my words had been given
scant attention. Of any land upheaval in the Pacific, my rescuers knew nothing;
nor did I deem it necessary to insist upon a thing which I knew they could not
believe. Once I sought out a celebrated ethnologist, and amused him with


peculiar questions regarding the ancient Philistine legend of Dagon, the Fish-
God; but soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional, I did not press my
inquiries.

It is at night, especially when the moon is gibbous and waning, that I see the
thing. I tried morphine; but the drug has given only transient surcease, and has
drawn me into its clutches as a hopeless slave. So now I am to end it all, having
written a full account for the information or the contemptuous amusement of my
fellow-men. Often I ask myself if it could not all have been a pure phantasm — a
mere freak of fever as I lay sun-stricken and raving in the open boat after my
escape from the German man-of-war. This I ask myself, but ever does there come
before me a hideously vivid vision in reply. I cannot think of the deep sea
without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very moment be
crawling and floundering on its slimy bed, worshipping their ancient stone idols
and carving their own detestable likenesses on submarine obelisks of water-
soaked granite. I dream of a day when they may rise above the billows to drag
down in their reeking talons the remnants of puny, war-exhausted mankind —
of a day when the land shall sink, and the dark ocean floor shall ascend amidst
universal pandemonium.

The end is near. I hear a noise at the door, as of some immense slippery body
lumbering against it. It shall not find me. God, that hand! The window! The
window!


Dreams in the Witch-House

Written Jan-28 Feb 1932

Published July 1933 in Weird Tales, Vol. 22, No. 1, 86-111.

Whether the dreams brought on the fever or the fever brought on the dreams
Walter Gilman did not know. Behind everything crouched the brooding,
festering horror of the ancient town, and of the mouldy, unhallowed garret gable
where he wrote and studied and wrestled with figures and formulae when he
was not tossing on the meagre iron bed. His ears were growing sensitive to a
preternatural and intolerable degree, and he had long ago stopped the cheap
mantel clock whose ticking had come to seem like a thunder of artillery. At night
the subtle stirring of the black city outside, the sinister scurrying of rats in the
wormy partitions, and the creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house,
were enough to give him a sense of strident pandemonium. The darkness always
teemed with unexplained sound - and yet he sometimes shook with fear lest the
noises he heard should subside and allow him to hear certain other fainter noises
which he suspected were lurking behind them.

He was in the changeless, legend-haunted city of Arkham, with its clustering
gambrel roofs that sway and sag over attics where witches hid from the King's
men in the dark, olden years of the Province. Nor was any spot in that city more
steeped in macabre memory than the gable room which harboured him - for it
was this house and this room which had likewise harboured old Keziah Mason,
whose flight from Salem Gaol at the last no one was ever able to explain. That
was in 1692 - the gaoler had gone mad and babbled of a small white-fanged furry
thing which scuttled out of Keziah's cell, and not even Cotton Mather could
explain the curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red,
sticky fluid.

Possibly Gilman ought not to have studied so hard. Non-Euclidean calculus and
quantum physics are enough to stretch any brain, and when one mixes them
with folklore, and tries to trace a strange background of multi-dimensional
reality behind the ghoulish hints of the Gothic tales and the wild whispers of the
chimney-corner, one can hardly expect to be wholly free from mental tension.
Gilman came from Haverhill, but it was only after he had entered college in
Arkham that he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of
elder magic. Something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his
imagination. The professors at Miskatonic had urged him to slacken up, and had
voluntarily cut down his course at several points. Moreover, they had stopped
him from consulting the dubious old books on forbidden secrets that were kept


under lock and key in a vault at the university library. But all these precautions
came late in the day, so that Gilman had some terrible hints from the dreaded
Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred, the fragmentary Book of Eibon, and the
suppressed Unaussprechlicken Kulten of von Junzt to correlate with his abstract
formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known and
unknown.

He knew his room was in the old Witch-House - that, indeed, was why he had
taken it. There was much in the Essex County records about Keziah Mason's
trial, and what she had admitted under pressure to the Court of Oyer and
Terminer had fascinated Gilman beyond all reason. She had told Judge Hathorne
of lines and curves that could be made to point out directions leading through
the walls of space to other spaces beyond, and had implied that such lines and
curves were frequently used at certain midnight meetings in the dark valley of
the white stone beyond Meadow Hill and on the unpeopled island in the river.
She had spoken also of the Black Man, of her oath, and of her new secret name of
Nahab. Then she had drawn those devices on the walls of her cell and vanished.

Gilman believed strange things about Keziah, and had felt a queer thrill on
learning that her dwelling was still standing after more than two hundred and
thirty-five years. When he heard the hushed Arkham whispers about Keziah's
persistent presence in the old house and the narrow streets, about the irregular
human tooth-marks left on certain sleepers in that and other houses, about the
childish cries heard near May-Eve, and Hallowmass, about the stench often
noted in the old house's attic just after those dreaded seasons, and about the
small, furry, sharp-toothed thing which haunted the mouldering structure and
the town and nuzzled people curiously in the black hours before dawn, he
resolved to live in the place at any cost. A room was easy to secure, for the house
was unpopular, hard to rent, and long given over to cheap lodgings. Gilman
could not have told what he expected to find there, but he knew he wanted to be
in the building where some circumstance had more or less suddenly given a
mediocre old woman of the Seventeenth Century an insight into mathematical
depths perhaps beyond the utmost modern delvings of Planck, Heisenberg,
Einstein, and de Sitter.

He studied the timber and plaster walls for traces of cryptic designs at every
accessible spot where the paper had peeled, and within a week managed to get
the eastern attic room where Keziah was held to have practised her spells. It had
been vacant from the first - for no one had ever been willing to stay there long -
but the Polish landlord had grown wary about renting it. Yet nothing whatever
happened to Gilman till about the time of the fever. No ghostly Keziah flitted
through the sombre halls and chambers, no small furry thing crept into his
dismal eyrie to nuzzle him, and no record of the witch's incantations rewarded


Herbert West: Reanitnator

I. From The Dark

Published Februrary 1922 in Home Brew Vol. 1, No. 1, p. 19-25.

Of Herbert West, who was my friend in college and in after life, I can speak only
with extreme terror. This terror is not due altogether to the sinister manner of his
recent disappearance, but was engendered by the whole nature of his life-work,
and first gained its acute form more than seventeen years ago, when we were in
the third year of our course at the Miskatonic University Medical School in
Arkham. While he was with me, the wonder and diabolism of his experiments
fascinated me utterly, and I was his closest companion. Now that he is gone and
the spell is broken, the actual fear is greater. Memories and possibilities are ever
more hideous than realities.

The first horrible incident of our acquaintance was the greatest shock I ever
experienced, and it is only with reluctance that I repeat it. As I have said, it
happened when we were in the medical school where West had already made
himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the
possibility of overcoming it artificially. His views, which were widely ridiculed
by the faculty and by his fellow-students, hinged on the essentially mechanistic
nature of life; and concerned means for operating the organic machinery of
mankind by calculated chemical action after the failure of natural processes. In
his experiments with various animating solutions, he had killed and treated
immense numbers of rabbits, guinea-pigs, cats, dogs, and monkeys, till he had
become the prime nuisance of the college. Several times he had actually obtained
signs of life in animals supposedly dead; in many cases violent signs but he soon
saw that the perfection of his process, if indeed possible, would necessarily
involve a lifetime of research. It likewise became clear that, since the same
solution never worked alike on different organic species, he would require
human subjects for further and more specialised progress. It was here that he
first came into conflict with the college authorities, and was debarred from future
experiments by no less a dignitary than the dean of the medical school himself —
the learned and benevolent Dr. Allan Halsey, whose work in behalf of the
stricken is recalled by every old resident of Arkham.



I had always been exceptionally tolerant of West's pursuits, and we frequently
discussed his theories, whose ramifications and corollaries were almost infinite.
Holding with Haeckel that all life is a chemical and physical process, and that the
so-called "soul" is a myth, my friend believed that artificial reanimation of the
dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues; and that unless actual
decomposition has set in, a corpse fully equipped with organs may with suitable
measures be set going again in the peculiar fashion known as life. That the
psychic or intellectual life might be impaired by the slight deterioration of
sensitive brain-cells which even a short period of death would be apt to cause.
West fully realised. It had at first been his hope to find a reagent which would
restore vitality before the actual advent of death, and only repeated failures on
animals had shewn him that the natural and artificial life-motions were
incompatible. He then sought extreme freshness in his specimens, injecting his
solutions into the blood immediately after the extinction of life. It was this
circumstance which made the professors so carelessly sceptical, for they felt that
true death had not occurred in any case. They did not stop to view the matter
closely and reasoningly.

It was not long after the faculty had interdicted his work that West confided to
me his resolution to get fresh human bodies in some manner, and continue in
secret the experiments he could no longer perform openly. To hear him
discussing ways and means was rather ghastly, for at the college we had never
procured anatomical specimens ourselves. Whenever the morgue proved
inadequate, two local negroes attended to this matter, and they were seldom
questioned. West was then a small, slender, spectacled youth with delicate
features, yellow hair, pale blue eyes, and a soft voice, and it was uncanny to hear
him dwelling on the relative merits of Christchurch Cemetery and the potter's
field. We finally decided on the potter's field, because practically every body in
Christchurch was embalmed; a thing of course ruinous to West's researches.

I was by this time his active and enthralled assistant, and helped him make all
his decisions, not only concerning the source of bodies but concerning a suitable
place for our loathsome work. It was I who thought of the deserted Chapman
farmhouse beyond Meadow Hill, where we fitted up on the ground floor an
operating room and a laboratory, each with dark curtains to conceal our
midnight doings. The place was far from any road, and in sight of no other
house, yet precautions were none the less necessary; since rumours of strange
lights, started by chance nocturnal roamers, would soon bring disaster on our
enterprise. It was agreed to call the whole thing a chemical laboratory if
discovery should occur. Gradually we equipped our sinister haunt of science
with materials either purchased in Boston or quietly borrowed from the college
— materials carefully made unrecognisable save to expert eyes — and provided
spades and picks for the many burials we should have to make in the cellar. At


the college we used an incinerator, but the apparatus was too costly for our
unauthorised laboratory. Bodies were always a nuisance — even the small
guinea-pig bodies from the slight clandestine experiments in West's room at the
boarding-house.

We followed the local death-notices like ghouls, for our specimens demanded
particular qualities. What we wanted were corpses interred soon after death and
without artificial preservation; preferably free from malforming disease, and
certainly with all organs present. Accident victims were our best hope. Not for
many weeks did we hear of anything suitable; though we talked with morgue
and hospital authorities, ostensibly in the college's interest, as often as we could
without exciting suspicion. We found that the college had first choice in every
case, so that it might be necessary to remain in Arkham during the summer,
when only the limited summer-school classes were held. In the end, though, luck
favoured us; for one day we heard of an almost ideal case in the potter's field; a
brawny young workman drowned only the morning before in Summer's Pond,
and buried at the town's expense without delay or embalming. That afternoon
we found the new grave, and determined to begin work soon after midnight. It
was a repulsive task that we undertook in the black small hours, even though we
lacked at that time the special horror of graveyards which later experiences
brought to us. We carried spades and oil dark lanterns, for although electric
torches were then manufactured, they were not as satisfactory as the tungsten
contrivances of today. The process of unearthing was slow and sordid — it might
have been gruesomely poetical if we had been artists instead of scientists — and
we were glad when our spades struck wood. When the pine box was fully
uncovered. West scrambled down and removed the lid, dragging out and
propping up the contents. I reached down and hauled the contents out of the
grave, and then both toiled hard to restore the spot to its former appearance. The
affair made us rather nervous, especially the stiff form and vacant face of our
first trophy, but we managed to remove all traces of our visit. When we had
patted down the last shovelful of earth, we put the specimen in a canvas sack
and set out for the old Chapman place beyond Meadow Hill.

On an improvised dissecting-table in the old farmhouse, by the light of a
powerful acetylene lamp, the specimen was not very spectral looking. It had
been a sturdy and apparently unimaginative youth of wholesome plebeian type
— large-framed, grey-eyed, and brown-haired — a sound animal without
psychological subtleties, and probably having vital processes of the simplest and
healthiest sort. Now, with the eyes closed, it looked more asleep than dead;
though the expert test of my friend soon left no doubt on that score. We had at
last what West had always longed for — a real dead man of the ideal kind, ready
for the solution as prepared according to the most careful calculations and
theories for human use. The tension on our part became very great. We knew


that there was scarcely a chance for anything hke complete success, and could
not avoid hideous fears at possible grotesque results of partial animation.
Especially were we apprehensive concerning the mind and impulses of the
creature, since in the space following death some of the more delicate cerebral
cells might well have suffered deterioration. I, myself, still held some curious
notions about the traditional "soul" of man, and felt an awe at the secrets that
might be told by one returning from the dead. I wondered what sights this placid
youth might have seen in inaccessible spheres, and what he could relate if fully
restored to life. But my wonder was not overwhelming, since for the most part I
shared the materialism of my friend. He was calmer than I as he forced a large
quantity of his fluid into a vein of the body's arm, immediately binding the
incision securely.

The waiting was gruesome, but West never faltered. Every now and then he
applied his stethoscope to the specimen, and bore the negative results
philosophically. After about three-quarters of an hour without the least sign of
life he disappointedly pronounced the solution inadequate, but determined to
make the most of his opportunity and try one change in the formula before
disposing of his ghastly prize. We had that afternoon dug a grave in the cellar,
and would have to fill it by dawn — for although we had fixed a lock on the
house, we wished to shun even the remotest risk of a ghoulish discovery.
Besides, the body would not be even approximately fresh the next night. So
taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent laboratory, we left our silent
guest on the slab in the dark, and bent every energy to the mixing of a new
solution; the weighing and measuring supervised by West with an almost
fanatical care.

The awful event was very sudden, and wholly unexpected. I was pouring
something from one test-tube to another, and West was busy over the alcohol
blast-lamp which had to answer for a Bunsen burner in this gasless edifice, when
from the pitch-black room we had left there burst the most appalling and
daemoniac succession of cries that either of us had ever heard. Not more
unutterable could have been the chaos of hellish sound if the pit itself had
opened to release the agony of the damned, for in one inconceivable cacophony
was centered all the supernal terror and unnatural despair of animate nature.
Human it could not have been — it is not in man to make such sounds — and
without a thought of our late employment or its possible discovery, both West
and I leaped to the nearest window like stricken animals; overturning tubes,
lamp, and retorts, and vaulting madly into the starred abyss of the rural night. I
think we screamed ourselves as we stumbled frantically toward the town,
though as we reached the outskirts we put on a semblance of restraint — just
enough to seem like belated revellers staggering home from a debauch.


We did not separate, but managed to get to West's room, where we whispered
with the gas up until dawn. By then we had calmed ourselves a little with
rational theories and plans for investigation, so that we could sleep through the
day — classes being disregarded. But that evening two items in the paper,
wholly unrelated, made it again impossible for us to sleep. The old deserted
Chapman house had inexplicably burned to an amorphous heap of ashes; that
we could understand because of the upset lamp. Also, an attempt had been made
to disturb a new grave in the potter's field, as if by futile and spadeless clawing
at the earth. That we could not understand, for we had patted down the mould
very carefully.

And for seventeen years after that West would look frequently over his shoulder,
and complain of fancied footsteps behind him. Now he has disappeared.

II. The Plague-Daemon

Pubhshed March 1922 in Home Brew Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 45-50.

I shall never forget that hideous summer sixteen years ago, when like a noxious
afrite from the halls of Eblis typhoid stalked leeringly through Arkham. It is by
that Satanic scourge that most recall the year, for truly terror brooded with bat-
wings over the piles of coffins in the tombs of Christchurch Cemetery; yet for me
there is a greater horror in that time — a horror known to me alone now that
Herbert West has disappeared.

West and I were doing post-graduate work in summer classes at the medical
school of Miskatonic University, and my friend had attained a wide notoriety
because of his experiments leading toward the revivification of the dead. After
the scientific slaughter of uncounted small animals the freakish work had
ostensibly stopped by order of our sceptical dean. Dr. Allan Halsey; though West
had continued to perform certain secret tests in his dingy boarding-house room,
and had on one terrible and unforgettable occasion taken a human body from its
grave in the potter's field to a deserted farmhouse beyond Meadow Hill.

I was with him on that odious occasion, and saw him inject into the still veins the
elixir which he thought would to some extent restore life's chemical and physical
processes. It had ended horribly — in a delirium of fear which we gradually
came to attribute to our own overwrought nerves — and West had never
afterward been able to shake off a maddening sensation of being haunted and
hunted. The body had not been quite fresh enough; it is obvious that to restore
normal mental attributes a body must be very fresh indeed; and the burning of
the old house had prevented us from burying the thing. It would have been
better if we could have known it was underground.


After that experience West had dropped his researches for some time; but as the
zeal of the born scientist slowly returned, he again became importunate with the
college faculty, pleading for the use of the dissecting-room and of fresh human
specimens for the work he regarded as so overwhelmingly important. His pleas,
however, were wholly in vain; for the decision of Dr. Halsey was inflexible, and
the other professors all endorsed the verdict of their leader. In the radical theory
of reanimation they saw nothing but the immature vagaries of a youthful
enthusiast whose slight form, yellow hair, spectacled blue eyes, and soft voice
gave no hint of the supernormal — almost diabolical — power of the cold brain
within. I can see him now as he was then — and I shiver. He grew sterner of face,
but never elderly. And now Sefton Asylum has had the mishap and West has
vanished.

West clashed disagreeably with Dr. Halsey near the end of our last
undergraduate term in a wordy dispute that did less credit to him than to the
kindiy dean in point of courtesy. He felt that he was needlessly and irrationally
retarded in a supremely great work; a work which he could of course conduct to
suit himself in later years, but which he wished to begin while still possessed of
the exceptional facilities of the university. That the tradition-bound elders should
ignore his singular results on animals, and persist in their denial of the
possibility of reanimation, was inexpressibly disgusting and almost
incomprehensible to a youth of West's logical temperament. Only greater
maturity could help him understand the chronic mental limitations of the
"professor-doctor" type — the product of generations of pathetic Puritanism;
kindly, conscientious, and sometimes gentle and amiable, yet always narrow,
intolerant, custom-ridden, and lacking in perspective. Age has more charity for
these incomplete yet high-souled characters, whose worst real vice is timidity,
and who are ultimately punished by general ridicule for their intellectual sins —
sins like Ptolemaism, Calvinism, anti-Darwinism, anti-Nietzscheism, and every
sort of Sabbatarianism and sumptuary legislation. West, young despite his
marvellous scientific acquirements, had scant patience with good Dr. Halsey and
his erudite colleagues; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a
desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and
dramatic fashion. Like most youths, he indulged in elaborate daydreams of
revenge, triumph, and final magnanimous forgiveness.

And then had come the scourge, grinning and lethal, from the nightmare caverns
of Tartarus. West and I had graduated about the time of its beginning, but had
remained for additional work at the summer school, so that we were in Arkham
when it broke with full daemoniac fury upon the town. Though not as yet
licenced physicians, we now had our degrees, and were pressed frantically into
public service as the numbers of the stricken grew. The situation was almost past
management, and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to


handle. Burials without embalming were made in rapid succession, and even the
Christchurch Cemetery receiving tomb was crammed with coffins of the
unembalmed dead. This circumstance was not without effect on West, who
thought often of the irony of the situation — so many fresh specimens, yet none
for his persecuted researches! We were frightfully overworked, and the terrific
mental and nervous strain made my friend brood morbidly.

But West's gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties. College
had all but closed, and every doctor of the medical faculty was helping to fight
the typhoid plague. Dr. Halsey in particular had distinguished himself in
sacrificing service, applying his extreme skill with whole-hearted energy to cases
which many others shunned because of danger or apparent hopelessness. Before
a month was over the fearless dean had become a popular hero, though he
seemed unconscious of his fame as he struggled to keep from collapsing with
physical fatigue and nervous exhaustion. West could not withhold admiration
for the fortitude of his foe, but because of this was even more determined to
prove to him the truth of his amazing doctrines. Taking advantage of the
disorganisation of both college work and municipal health regulations, he
managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the university
dissecting-room one night, and in my presence injected a new modification of his
solution. The thing actually opened its eyes, but only stared at the ceiling with a
look of soul-petrifying horror before collapsing into an inertness from which
nothing could rouse it. West said it was not fresh enough — the hot summer air
does not favour corpses. That time we were almost caught before we incinerated
the thing, and West doubted the advisability of repeating his daring misuse of
the college laboratory.

The peak of the epidemic was reached in August. West and I were almost dead,
and Dr. Halsey did die on the 14th. The students all attended the hasty funeral
on the 15th, and bought an impressive wreath, though the latter was quite
overshadowed by the tributes sent by wealthy Arkham citizens and by the
municipality itself. It was almost a public affair, for the dean had surely been a
public benefactor. After the entombment we were all somewhat depressed, and
spent the afternoon at the bar of the Commercial House; where West, though
shaken by the death of his chief opponent, chilled the rest of us with references to
his notorious theories. Most of the students went home, or to various duties, as
the evening advanced; but West persuaded me to aid him in "making a night of
it." West's landlady saw us arrive at his room about two in the morning, with a
third man between us; and told her husband that we had all evidently dined and
wined rather well.

Apparently this acidulous matron was right; for about 3 a.m. the whole house
was aroused by cries coming from West's room, where when they broke down


the door, they found the two of us unconscious on the blood-stained carpet,
beaten, scratched, and mauled, and with the broken remnants of West's bottles
and instruments around us. Only an open window told what had become of our
assailant, and many wondered how he himself had fared after the terrific leap
from the second story to the lawn which he must have made. There were some
strange garments in the room, but West upon regaining consciousness said they
did not belong to the stranger, but were specimens collected for bacteriological
analysis in the course of investigations on the transmission of germ diseases. He
ordered them burnt as soon as possible in the capacious fireplace. To the police
we both declared ignorance of our late companion's identity. He was. West
nervously said, a congenial stranger whom we had met at some downtown bar
of uncertain location. We had all been rather jovial, and West and I did not wish
to have our pugnacious companion hunted down.

That same night saw the beginning of the second Arkham horror — the horror
that to me eclipsed the plague itself. Christchurch Cemetery was the scene of a
terrible killing; a watchman having been clawed to death in a manner not only
too hideous for description, but raising a doubt as to the human agency of the
deed. The victim had been seen alive considerably after midnight — the dawn
revealed the unutterable thing. The manager of a circus at the neighbouring town
of Bolton was questioned, but he swore that no beast had at any time escaped
from its cage. Those who found the body noted a trail of blood leading to the
receiving tomb, where a small pool of red lay on the concrete just outside the
gate. A fainter trail led away toward the woods, but it soon gave out.

The next night devils danced on the roofs of Arkham, and unnatural madness
howled in the wind. Through the fevered town had crept a curse which some
said was greater than the plague, and which some whispered was the embodied
daemon-soul of the plague itself. Eight houses were entered by a nameless thing
which strewed red death in its wake — in all, seventeen maimed and shapeless
remnants of bodies were left behind by the voiceless, sadistic monster that crept
abroad. A few persons had half seen it in the dark, and said it was white and like
a malformed ape or anthropomorphic fiend. It had not left behind quite all that it
had attacked, for sometimes it had been hungry. The number it had killed was
fourteen; three of the bodies had been in stricken homes and had not been alive.

On the third night frantic bands of searchers, led by the police, captured it in a
house on Crane Street near the Miskatonic campus. They had organised the quest
with care, keeping in touch by means of volunteer telephone stations, and when
someone in the college district had reported hearing a scratching at a shuttered
window, the net was quickly spread. On account of the general alarm and
precautions, there were only two more victims, and the capture was effected
without major casualties. The thing was finally stopped by a bullet, though not a

fatal one, and was rushed to the local hospital amidst universal excitement and
loathing.

For it had been a man. This much was clear despite the nauseous eyes, the
voiceless simianism, and the daemoniac savagery. They dressed its wound and
carted it to the asylum at Sefton, where it beat its head against the walls of a
padded cell for sixteen years — until the recent mishap, when it escaped under
circumstances that few like to mention. What had most disgusted the searchers
of Arkham was the thing they noticed when the monster's face was cleaned —
the mocking, unbelievable resemblance to a learned and self-sacrificing martyr
who had been entombed but three days before — the late Dr. Allan Halsey,
public benefactor and dean of the medical school of Miskatonic University.

To the vanished Herbert West and to me the disgust and horror were supreme. I
shudder tonight as I think of it; shudder even more than I did that morning
when West muttered through his bandages, "Damn it, it wasn't quite fresh
enough!"

III. Six Shots by MoonHght

Pubhshed April 1922 in Home Brew Vol. 1, No. 3, p. 21-26.

It is uncommon to fire all six shots of a revolver with great suddenness when one
would probably be sufficient, but many things in the life of Herbert West were
uncommon. It is, for instance, not often that a young physician leaving college is
obliged to conceal the principles which guide his selection of a home and office,
yet that was the case with Herbert West. When he and I obtained our degrees at
the medical school of Miskatonic University, and sought to relieve our poverty
by setting up as general practitioners, we took great care not to say that we chose
our house because it was fairly well isolated, and as near as possible to the
potter's field.

Reticence such as this is seldom without a cause, nor indeed was ours; for our
requirements were those resulting from a life-work distinctly unpopular.
Outwardly we were doctors only, but beneath the surface were aims of far
greater and more terrible moment — for the essence of Herbert West's existence
was a quest amid black and forbidden realms of the unknown, in which he
hoped to uncover the secret of life and restore to perpetual animation the
graveyard's cold clay. Such a quest demands strange materials, among them
fresh human bodies; and in order to keep supplied with these indispensable
things one must live quietly and not far from a place of informal interment.

West and I had met in college, and I had been the only one to sympathise with
his hideous experiments. Gradually I had come to be his inseparable assistant,
and now that we were out of college we had to keep together. It was not easy to
find a good opening for two doctors in company, but finally the influence of the
university secured us a practice in Bolton — a factory town near Arkham, the
seat of the college. The Bolton Worsted Mills are the largest in the Miskatonic
Valley, and their polyglot employees are never popular as patients with the local
physicians. We chose our house with the greatest care, seizing at last on a rather
run-down cottage near the end of Pond Street; five numbers from the closest
neighbour, and separated from the local potter's field by only a stretch of
meadow land, bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to
the north. The distance was greater than we wished, but we could get no nearer
house without going on the other side of the field, wholly out of the factory
district. We were not much displeased, however, since there were no people
between us and our sinister source of supplies. The walk was a trifle long, but we
could haul our silent specimens undisturbed.

Our practice was surprisingly large from the very first — large enough to please
most young doctors, and large enough to prove a bore and a burden to students
whose real interest lay elsewhere. The mill-hands were of somewhat turbulent
inclinations; and besides their many natural needs, their frequent clashes and
stabbing affrays gave us plenty to do. But what actually absorbed our minds was
the secret laboratory we had fitted up in the cellar — the laboratory with the long
table under the electric lights, where in the small hours of the morning we often
injected West's various solutions into the veins of the things we dragged from
the potter's field. West was experimenting madly to find something which
would start man's vital motions anew after they had been stopped by the thing
we call death, but had encountered the most ghastly obstacles. The solution had
to be differently compounded for different types — what would serve for
guinea-pigs would not serve for human beings, and different human specimens
required large modifications.

The bodies had to be exceedingly fresh, or the slight decomposition of brain
tissue would render perfect reanimation impossible. Indeed, the greatest
problem was to get them fresh enough — West had had horrible experiences
during his secret college researches with corpses of doubtful vintage. The results
of partial or imperfect animation were much more hideous than were the total
failures, and we both held fearsome recollections of such things. Ever since our
first daemoniac session in the deserted farmhouse on Meadow Hill in Arkham,
we had felt a brooding menace; and West, though a calm, blond, blue-eyed
scientific automaton in most respects, often confessed to a shuddering sensation
of stealthy pursuit. He half felt that he was followed — a psychological delusion
of shaken nerves, enhanced by the undeniably disturbing fact that at least one of


our reanimated specimens was still alive — a frightful carnivorous thing in a
padded cell at Sefton. Then there was another — our first — whose exact fate we
had never learned.

We had fair luck with specimens in Bolton — much better than in Arkham. We
had not been settled a week before we got an accident victim on the very night of
burial, and made it open its eyes with an amazingly rational expression before
the solution failed. It had lost an arm — if it had been a perfect body we might
have succeeded better. Between then and the next January we secured three
more; one total failure, one case of marked muscular motion, and one rather
shivery thing — it rose of itself and uttered a sound. Then came a period when
luck was poor; interments fell off, and those that did occur were of specimens
either too diseased or too maimed for use. We kept track of all the deaths and
their circumstances with systematic care.

One March night, however, we unexpectedly obtained a specimen which did not
come from the potter's field. In Bolton the prevailing spirit of Puritanism had
outlawed the sport of boxing — with the usual result. Surreptitious and ill-
conducted bouts among the mill-workers were common, and occasionally
professional talent of low grade was imported. This late winter night there had
been such a match; evidently with disastrous results, since two timorous Poles
had come to us with incoherently whispered entreaties to attend to a very secret
and desperate case. We followed them to an abandoned barn, where the
remnants of a crowd of frightened foreigners were watching a silent black form
on the floor.

The match had been between Kid O'Brien — a lubberly and now quaking youth
with a most un-Hibernian hooked nose — and Buck Robinson, "The Harlem
Smoke." The negro had been knocked out, and a moment's examination shewed
us that he would permanently remain so. He was a loathsome, gorilla-like thing,
with abnormally long arms which I could not help calling fore legs, and a face
that conjured up thoughts of unspeakable Congo secrets and tom-tom poundings
under an eerie moon. The body must have looked even worse in life — but the
world holds many ugly things. Fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd, for they
did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up;
and they were grateful when West, in spite of my involuntary shudders, offered
to get rid of the thing quietly — for a purpose I knew too well.

There was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape, but we dressed the
thing and carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows,
as we had carried a similar thing one horrible night in Arkham. We approached
the house from the field in the rear, took the specimen in the back door and
down the cellar stairs, and prepared it for the usual experiment. Our fear of the



police was absurdly great, though we had timed our trip to avoid the solitary
patrolman of that section.

The result was wearily anticlimactic. Ghastly as our prize appeared, it was
wholly unresponsive to every solution we injected in its black arm; solutions
prepared from experience with white specimens only. So as the hour grew
dangerously near to dawn, we did as we had done with the others — dragged
the thing across the meadows to the neck of the woods near the potter's field,
and buried it there in the best sort of grave the frozen ground would furnish. The
grave was not very deep, but fully as good as that of the previous specimen —
the thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound. In the light of our dark
lanterns we carefully covered it with leaves and dead vines, fairly certain that the
police would never find it in a forest so dim and dense.

The next day I was increasingly apprehensive about the police, for a patient
brought rumours of a suspected fight and death. West had still another source of
worry, for he had been called in the afternoon to a case which ended very
threateningly. An Italian woman had become hysterical over her missing child —
a lad of five who had strayed off early in the morning and failed to appear for
dinner — and had developed symptoms highly alarming in view of an always
weak heart. It was a very foolish hysteria, for the boy had often run away before;
but Italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious, and this woman seemed as
much harassed by omens as by facts. About seven o'clock in the evening she had
died, and her frantic husband had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill
West, whom he wildly blamed for not saving her life. Friends had held him
when he drew a stiletto, but West departed amidst his inhuman shrieks, curses
and oaths of vengeance. In his latest affliction the fellow seemed to have
forgotten his child, who was still missing as the night advanced. There was some
talk of searching the woods, but most of the family's friends were busy with the
dead woman and the screaming man. Altogether, the nervous strain upon West
must have been tremendous. Thoughts of the police and of the mad Italian both
weighed heavily.

We retired about eleven, but I did not sleep well. Bolton had a surprisingly good
police force for so small a town, and I could not help fearing the mess which
would ensue if the affair of the night before were ever tracked down. It might
mean the end of all our local work — and perhaps prison for both West and me. I
did not like those rumours of a fight which were floating about. After the clock
had struck three the moon shone in my eyes, but I turned over without rising to
pull down the shade. Then came the steady rattling at the back door.

I lay still and somewhat dazed, but before long heard West's rap on my door. He
was clad in dressing- gown and slippers, and had in his hands a revolver and an


electric flashlight. From the revolver I knew that he was thinking more of the
crazed Italian than of the police.

"We'd better both go/' he whispered. "It wouldn't do not to answer it anyway,
and it may be a patient — it would be like one of those fools to try the back
door."

So we both went down the stairs on tiptoe, with a fear partly justified and partly
that which comes only from the soul of the weird small hours. The rattling
continued, growing somewhat louder. When we reached the door I cautiously
unbolted it and threw it open, and as the moon streamed revealingly down on
the form silhouetted there. West did a peculiar thing. Despite the obvious danger
of attracting notice and bringing down on our heads the dreaded police
investigation — a thing which after all was mercifully averted by the relative
isolation of our cottage — my friend suddenly, excitedly, and unnecessarily
emptied all six chambers of his revolver into the nocturnal visitor.

For that visitor was neither Italian nor policeman. Looming hideously against the
spectral moon was a gigantic misshapen thing not to be imagined save in
nightmares — a glassy-eyed, ink-black apparition nearly on all fours, covered
with bits of mould, leaves, and vines, foul with caked blood, and having between
its glistening teeth a snow-white, terrible, cylindrical object terminating in a tiny
hand.

IV. The Scream of the Dead

Pubhshed May 1922 in Home Brew Vol. 1, No. 4, p. 53-58.

The scream of a dead man gave to me that acute and added horror of Dr. Herbert
West which harassed the latter years of our companionship. It is natural that
such a thing as a dead man's scream should give horror, for it is obviously, not a
pleasing or ordinary occurrence; but I was used to similar experiences, hence
suffered on this occasion only because of a particular circumstance. And, as I
have implied, it was not of the dead man himself that I became afraid.

Herbert West, whose associate and assistant I was, possessed scientific interests
far beyond the usual routine of a village physician. That was why, when
establishing his practice in Bolton, he had chosen an isolated house near the
potter's field. Briefly and brutally stated. West's sole absorbing interest was a
secret study of the phenomena of life and its cessation, leading toward the
reanimation of the dead through injections of an excitant solution. For this
ghastly experimenting it was necessary to have a constant supply of very fresh
human bodies; very fresh because even the least decay hopelessly damaged the


brain structure, and human because we found that the solution had to be
compounded differently for different types of organisms. Scores of rabbits and
guinea-pigs had been killed and treated, but their trail was a blind one. West had
never fully succeeded because he had never been able to secure a corpse
sufficiently fresh. What he wanted were bodies from which vitality had only just
departed; bodies with every cell intact and capable of receiving again the
impulse toward that mode of motion called life. There was hope that this second
and artificial life might be made perpetual by repetitions of the injection, but we
had learned that an ordinary natural life would not respond to the action. To
establish the artificial motion, natural life must be extinct — the specimens must
be very fresh, but genuinely dead.

The awesome quest had begun when West and I were students at the Miskatonic
University Medical School in Arkham, vividly conscious for the first time of the
thoroughly mechanical nature of life. That was seven years before, but West
looked scarcely a day older now — he was small, blond, clean-shaven, soft-
voiced, and spectacled, with only an occasional flash of a cold blue eye to tell of
the hardening and growing fanaticism of his character under the pressure of his
terrible investigations. Our experiences had often been hideous in the extreme;
the results of defective reanimation, when lumps of graveyard clay had been
galvanised into morbid, unnatural, and brainless motion by various
modifications of the vital solution.

One thing had uttered a nerve-shattering scream; another had risen violently,
beaten us both to unconsciousness, and run amuck in a shocking way before it
could be placed behind asylum bars; still another, a loathsome African
monstrosity, had clawed out of its shallow grave and done a deed — West had
had to shoot that object. We could not get bodies fresh enough to shew any trace
of reason when reanimated, so had perforce created nameless horrors. It was
disturbing to think that one, perhaps two, of our monsters still lived — that
thought haunted us shadowingly, till finally West disappeared under frightful
circumstances. But at the time of the scream in the cellar laboratory of the
isolated Bolton cottage, our fears were subordinate to our anxiety for extremely
fresh specimens. West was more avid than I, so that it almost seemed to me that
he looked half-covetously at any very healthy living physique.

It was in July, 1910, that the bad luck regarding specimens began to turn. I had
been on a long visit to my parents in Illinois, and upon my return found West in
a state of singular elation. He had, he told me excitedly, in all likelihood solved
the problem of freshness through an approach from an entirely new angle — that
of artificial preservation. I had known that he was working on a new and highly
unusual embalming compound, and was not surprised that it had turned out
well; but until he explained the details I was rather puzzled as to how such a

compound could help in our work, since the objectionable staleness of the
specimens was largely due to delay occurring before we secured them. This, I
now saw. West had clearly recognised; creating his embalming compound for
future rather than immediate use, and trusting to fate to supply again some very
recent and unburied corpse, as it had years before when we obtained the negro
killed in the Bolton prize-fight. At last fate had been kind, so that on this occasion
there lay in the secret cellar laboratory a corpse whose decay could not by any
possibility have begun. What would happen on reanimation, and whether we
could hope for a revival of mind and reason. West did not venture to predict. The
experiment would be a landmark in our studies, and he had saved the new body
for my return, so that both might share the spectacle in accustomed fashion.

West told me how he had obtained the specimen. It had been a vigorous man; a
well-dressed stranger just off the train on his way to transact some business with
the Bolton Worsted Mills. The walk through the town had been long, and by the
time the traveller paused at our cottage to ask the way to the factories, his heart
had become greatly overtaxed. He had refused a stimulant, and had suddenly
dropped dead only a moment later. The body, as might be expected, seemed to
West a heaven-sent gift. In his brief conversation the stranger had made it clear
that he was unknown in Bolton, and a search of his pockets subsequently
revealed him to be one Robert Leavitt of St. Louis, apparently without a family to
make instant inquiries about his disappearance. If this man could not be restored
to life, no one would know of our experiment. We buried our materials in a
dense strip of woods between the house and the potter's field. If, on the other
hand, he could be restored, our fame would be brilliantly and perpetually
established. So without delay West had injected into the body's wrist the
compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival. The matter of the
presumably weak heart, which to my mind imperilled the success of our
experiment, did not appear to trouble West extensively. He hoped at last to
obtain what he had never obtained before — a rekindled spark of reason and
perhaps a normal, living creature.

So on the night of July 18, 1910, Herbert West and I stood in the cellar laboratory
and gazed at a white, silent figure beneath the dazzling arc-light. The embalming
compound had worked uncannily well, for as I stared fascinatedly at the sturdy
frame which had lain two weeks without stiffening, I was moved to seek West's
assurance that the thing was really dead. This assurance he gave readily enough;
reminding me that the reanimating solution was never used without careful tests
as to life, since it could have no effect if any of the original vitality were present.
As West proceeded to take preliminary steps, I was impressed by the vast
intricacy of the new experiment; an intricacy so vast that he could trust no hand
less delicate than his own. Forbidding me to touch the body, he first injected a
drug in the wrist just beside the place his needle had punctured when injecting

the embalming compound. This, he said, was to neutrahse the compound and
release the system to a normal relaxation so that the reanimating solution might
freely work when injected. Slightly later, when a change and a gentle tremor
seemed to affect the dead limbs; West stuffed a pillow-like object violently over
the twitching face, not withdrawing it until the corpse appeared quiet and ready
for our attempt at reanimation. The pale enthusiast now applied some last
perfunctory tests for absolute lifelessness, withdrew satisfied, and finally injected
into the left arm an accurately measured amount of the vital elixir, prepared
during the afternoon with a greater care than we had used since college days,
when our feats were new and groping. I cannot express the wild, breathless
suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimen —
the first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech, perhaps to
tell of what it had seen beyond the unfathomable abyss.

West was a materialist, believing in no soul and attributing all the working of
consciousness to bodily phenomena; consequently he looked for no revelation of
hideous secrets from gulfs and caverns beyond death's barrier. I did not wholly
disagree with him theoretically, yet held vague instinctive remnants of the
primitive faith of my forefathers; so that I could not help eyeing the corpse with a
certain amount of awe and terrible expectation. Besides — I could not extract
from my memory that hideous, inhuman shriek we heard on the night we tried
our first experiment in the deserted farmhouse at Arkham.

Very little time had elapsed before I saw the attempt was not to be a total failure.
A touch of colour came to cheeks hitherto chalk-white, and spread out under the
curiously ample stubble of sandy beard. West, who had his hand on the pulse of
the left wrist, suddenly nodded significantly; and almost simultaneously a mist
appeared on the mirror inclined above the body's mouth. There followed a few
spasmodic muscular motions, and then an audible breathing and visible motion
of the chest. I looked at the closed eyelids, and thought I detected a quivering.
Then the lids opened, shewing eyes which were grey, calm, and alive, but still
unintelligent and not even curious.

In a moment of fantastic whim I whispered questions to the reddening ears;
questions of other worlds of which the memory might still be present.
Subsequent terror drove them from my mind, but I think the last one, which I
repeated, was: "Where have you been?" I do not yet know whether I was
answered or not, for no sound came from the well-shaped mouth; but I do know
that at that moment I firmly thought the thin lips moved silently, forming
syllables which I would have vocalised as "only now" if that phrase had
possessed any sense or relevancy. At that moment, as I say, I was elated with the
conviction that the one great goal had been attained; and that for the first time a
reanimated corpse had uttered distinct words impelled by actual reason. In the

next moment there was no doubt about the triumph; no doubt that the solution
had truly accomplished, at least temporarily, its full mission of restoring rational
and articulate life to the dead. But in that triumph there came to me the greatest
of all horrors — not horror of the thing that spoke, but of the deed that I had
witnessed and of the man with whom my professional fortunes were joined.

For that very fresh body, at last writhing into full and terrifying consciousness
with eyes dilated at the memory of its last scene on earth, threw out its frantic
hands in a life and death struggle with the air, and suddenly collapsing into a
second and final dissolution from which there could be no return, screamed out
the cry that will ring eternally in my aching brain:

"Help! Keep off, you cursed little tow-head fiend — keep that damned needle
away from me!"

V. The Horror From the Shadows

Pubhshed June 1922 in Home Brew Vol. 1, No. 5, p. 45-50.

Many men have related hideous things, not mentioned in print, which happened
on the battlefields of the Great War. Some of these things have made me faint,
others have convulsed me with devastating nausea, while still others have made
me tremble and look behind me in the dark; yet despite the worst of them I
believe I can myself relate the most hideous thing of all — the shocking, the
unnatural, the unbelievable horror from the shadows.

In 1915 I was a physician with the rank of First Lieutenant in a Canadian
regiment in Flanders, one of many Americans to precede the government itself
into the gigantic struggle. I had not entered the army on my own initiative, but
rather as a natural result of the enlistment of the man whose indispensable
assistant I was — the celebrated Boston surgical specialist. Dr. Herbert West. Dr.
West had been avid for a chance to serve as surgeon in a great war, and when the
chance had come, he carried me with him almost against my will. There were
reasons why I could have been glad to let the war separate us; reasons why I
found the practice of medicine and the companionship of West more and more
irritating; but when he had gone to Ottawa and through a colleague's influence
secured a medical commission as Major, I could not resist the imperious
persuasion of one determined that I should accompany him in my usual
capacity.

When I say that Dr. West was avid to serve in battle, I do not mean to imply that
he was either naturally warlike or anxious for the safety of civilisation. Always
an ice-cold intellectual machine; slight, blond, blue-eyed, and spectacled; I think


he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine
neutrality. There was, however, something he wanted in embattled Flanders; and
in order to secure it had had to assume a military exterior. What he wanted was
not a thing which many persons want, but something connected with the
peculiar branch of medical science which he had chosen quite clandestinely to
follow, and in which he had achieved amazing and occasionally hideous results.
It was, in fact, nothing more or less than an abundant supply of freshly killed
men in every stage of dismemberment.

Herbert West needed fresh bodies because his life-work was the reanimation of
the dead. This work was not known to the fashionable clientele who had so
swiftly built up his fame after his arrival in Boston; but was only too well known
to me, who had been his closest friend and sole assistant since the old days in
Miskatonic University Medical School at Arkham. It was in those college days
that he had begun his terrible experiments, first on small animals and then on
human bodies shockingly obtained. There was a solution which he injected into
the veins of dead things, and if they were fresh enough they responded in
strange ways. He had had much trouble in discovering the proper formula, for
each type of organism was found to need a stimulus especially adapted to it.
Terror stalked him when he reflected on his partial failures; nameless things
resulting from imperfect solutions or from bodies insufficiently fresh. A certain
number of these failures had remained alive — one was in an asylum while
others had vanished — and as he thought of conceivable yet virtually impossible
eventualities he often shivered beneath his usual stolidity.

West had soon learned that absolute freshness was the prime requisite for useful
specimens, and had accordingly resorted to frightful and unnatural expedients in
body-snatching. In college, and during our early practice together in the factory
town of Bolton, my attitude toward him had been largely one of fascinated
admiration; but as his boldness in methods grew, I began to develop a gnawing
fear. I did not like the way he looked at healthy living bodies; and then there
came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when I learned that a certain
specimen had been a living body when he secured it. That was the first time he
had ever been able to revive the quality of rational thought in a corpse; and his
success, obtained at such a loathsome cost, had completely hardened him.

Of his methods in the intervening five years I dare not speak. I was held to him
by sheer force of fear, and witnessed sights that no human tongue could repeat.
Gradually I came to find Herbert West himself more horrible than anything he
did — that was when it dawned on me that his once normal scientific zeal for
prolonging life had subtly degenerated into a mere morbid and ghoulish
curiosity and secret sense of charnel picturesqueness. His interest became a
hellish and perverse addiction to the repellently and fiendishly abnormal; he


gloated calmly over artificial monstrosities which would make most healthy men
drop dead from fright and disgust; he became, behind his pallid intellectuality, a
fastidious Baudelaire of physical experiment — a languid Elagabalus of the
tombs.

Dangers he met unflinchingly; crimes he committed unmoved. I think the climax
came when he had proved his point that rational life can be restored, and had
sought new worlds to conquer by experimenting on the reanimation of detached
parts of bodies. He had wild and original ideas on the independent vital
properties of organic cells and nerve-tissue separated from natural physiological
systems; and achieved some hideous preliminary results in the form of never-
dying, artificially nourished tissue obtained from the nearly hatched eggs of an
indescribable tropical reptile. Two biological points he was exceedingly anxious
to settle — first, whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be
possible without the brain, proceeding from the spinal cord and various nerve-
centres; and second, whether any kind of ethereal, intangible relation distinct
from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what
has previously been a single living organism. All this research work required a
prodigious supply of freshly slaughtered human flesh — and that was why
Herbert West had entered the Great War.

The phantasmal, unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in March,
1915, in a field hospital behind the lines of St. Eloi. I wonder even now if it could
have been other than a daemoniac dream of delirium. West had a private
laboratory in an east room of the barn-like temporary edifice, assigned him on
his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for the treatment of
hitherto hopeless cases of maiming. There he worked like a butcher in the midst
of his gory wares — I could never get used to the levity with which he handled
and classified certain things. At times he actually did perform marvels of surgery
for the soldiers; but his chief delights were of a less public and philanthropic
kind, requiring many explanations of sounds which seemed peculiar even
amidst that babel of the damned. Among these sounds were frequent revolver-
shots — surely not uncommon on a battlefield, but distinctly uncommon in an
hospital. Dr. West's reanimated specimens were not meant for long existence or a
large audience. Besides human tissue. West employed much of the reptile
embryo tissue which he had cultivated with such singular results. It was better
than human material for maintaining life in organless fragments, and that was
now my friend's chief activity. In a dark corner of the laboratory, over a queer
incubating burner, he kept a large covered vat full of this reptilian cell-matter;
which multiplied and grew puffily and hideously.

On the night of which I speak we had a splendid new specimen — a man at once
physically powerful and of such high mentality that a sensitive nervous system


was assured. It was rather ironic, for he was the officer who had helped West to
his commission, and who was now to have been our associate. Moreover, he had
in the past secretly studied the theory of reanimation to some extent under West.
Major Sir Eric Moreland Clapham-Lee, D.S.O., was the greatest surgeon in our
division, and had been hastily assigned to the St. Eloi sector when news of the
heavy fighting reached headquarters. He had come in an aeroplane piloted by
the intrepid Lieut. Ronald Hill, only to be shot down when directly over his
destination. The fall had been spectacular and awful; Hill was unrecognisable
afterward, but the wreck yielded up the great surgeon in a nearly decapitated
but otherwise intact condition. West had greedily seized the lifeless thing which
had once been his friend and fellow-scholar; and I shuddered when he finished
severing the head, placed it in his hellish vat of pulpy reptile-tissue to preserve it
for future experiments, and proceeded to treat the decapitated body on the
operating table. He injected new blood, joined certain veins, arteries, and nerves
at the headless neck, and closed the ghastly aperture with engrafted skin from an
unidentified specimen which had borne an officer's uniform. I knew what he
wanted — to see if this highly organised body could exhibit, without its head,
any of the signs of mental life which had distinguished Sir Eric Moreland
Clapham-Lee. Once a student of reanimation, this silent trunk was now
gruesomely called upon to exemplify it.

I can still see Herbert West under the sinister electric light as he injected his
reanimating solution into the arm of the headless body. The scene I cannot
describe — I should faint if I tried it, for there is madness in a room full of
classified charnel things, with blood and lesser human debris almost ankle-deep
on the slimy floor, and with hideous reptilian abnormalities sprouting, bubbling,
and baking over a winking bluish-green spectre of dim flame in a far corner of
black shadows.

The specimen, as West repeatedly observed, had a splendid nervous system.
Much was expected of it; and as a few twitching motions began to appear, I
could see the feverish interest on West's face. He was ready, I think, to see proof
of his increasingly strong opinion that consciousness, reason, and personality can
exist independently of the brain — that man has no central connective spirit, but
is merely a machine of nervous matter, each section more or less complete in
itself. In one triumphant demonstration West was about to relegate the mystery
of life to the category of myth. The body now twitched more vigorously, and
beneath our avid eyes commenced to heave in a frightful way. The arms stirred
disquietingly, the legs drew up, and various muscles contracted in a repulsive
kind of writhing. Then the headless thing threw out its arms in a gesture which
was unmistakably one of desperation — an intelligent desperation apparently
sufficient to prove every theory of Herbert West. Certainly, the nerves were
recalling the man's last act in life; the struggle to get free of the falling aeroplane.

What followed, I shall never positively know. It may have been wholly an
hallucination from the shock caused at that instant by the sudden and complete
destruction of the building in a cataclysm of German shell-fire — who can
gainsay it, since West and I were the only proved survivors? West liked to think
that before his recent disappearance, but there were times when he could not; for
it was queer that we both had the same hallucination. The hideous occurrence
itself was very simple, notable only for what it implied.

The body on the table had risen with a blind and terrible groping, and we had
heard a sound. I should not call that sound a voice, for it was too awful. And yet
its timbre was not the most awful thing about it. Neither was its message — it
had merely screamed, "Jump, Ronald, for God's sake, jump!" The awful thing
was its source.

For it had come from the large covered vat in that ghoulish corner of crawling
black shadows.

VI. The Tomb-Legions

Pubhshed July 1922 in Home Brew Vol. 1, No. 6, p. 57-62.

When Dr. Herbert West disappeared a year ago, the Boston police questioned me
closely. They suspected that I was holding something back, and perhaps
suspected graver things; but I could not tell them the truth because they would
not have believed it. They knew, indeed, that West had been connected with
activities beyond the credence of ordinary men; for his hideous experiments in
the reanimation of dead bodies had long been too extensive to admit of perfect
secrecy; but the final soul-shattering catastrophe held elements of daemoniac
phantasy which make even me doubt the reality of what I saw.

I was West's closest friend and only confidential assistant. We had met years
before, in medical school, and from the first I had shared his terrible researches.
He had slowly tried to perfect a solution which, injected into the veins of the
newly deceased, would restore life; a labour demanding an abundance of fresh
corpses and therefore involving the most unnatural actions. Still more shocking
were the products of some of the experiments — grisly masses of flesh that had
been dead, but that West waked to a blind, brainless, nauseous ammation. These
were the usual results, for in order to reawaken the mind it was necessary to
have specimens so absolutely fresh that no decay could possibly affect the
delicate brain- cells.

This need for very fresh corpses had been West's moral undoing. They were hard
to get, and one awful day he had secured his specimen while it was still alive and


vigorous. A struggle, a needle, and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a
very fresh corpse, and the experiment had succeeded for a brief and memorable
moment; but West had emerged with a soul calloused and seared, and a
hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous and calculating
appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous physique.
Toward the last I became acutely afraid of West, for he began to look at me that
way. People did not seem to notice his glances, but they noticed my fear; and
after his disappearance used that as a basis for some absurd suspicions.

West, in reality, was more afraid than I; for his abominable pursuits entailed a
life of furtiveness and dread of every shadow. Partly it was the police he feared;
but sometimes his nervousness was deeper and more nebulous, touching on
certain indescribable things into which he had injected a morbid life, and from
which he had not seen that life depart. He usually finished his experiments with
a revolver, but a few times he had not been quick enough. There was that first
specimen on whose rifled grave marks of clawing were later seen. There was also
that Arkham professor's body which had done cannibal things before it had been
captured and thrust unidentified into a madhouse cell at Sefton, where it beat the
walls for sixteen years. Most of the other possibly surviving results were things
less easy to speak of — for in later years West's scientific zeal had degenerated to
an unhealthy and fantastic mania, and he had spent his chief skill in vitalising
not entire human bodies but isolated parts of bodies, or parts joined to organic
matter other than human. It had become fiendishly disgusting by the time he
disappeared; many of the experiments could not even be hinted at in print. The
Great War, through which both of us served as surgeons, had intensified this
side of West.

In saying that West's fear of his specimens was nebulous, I have in mind
particularly its complex nature. Part of it came merely from knowing of the
existence of such nameless monsters, while another part arose from
apprehension of the bodily harm they might under certain circumstances do him.
Their disappearance added horror to the situation — of them all. West knew the
whereabouts of only one, the pitiful asylum thing. Then there was a more subtle
fear — a very fantastic sensation resulting from a curious experiment in the
Canadian army in 1915. West, in the midst of a severe battle, had reanimated
Major Sir Eric Moreland Clapham-Lee, D.S.O., a fellow-physician who knew
about his experiments and could have duplicated them. The head had been
removed, so that the possibilities of quasi-intelligent life in the trunk might be
investigated. Just as the building was wiped out by a German shell, there had
been a success. The trunk had moved intelligently; and, unbelievable to relate,
we were both sickeningly sure that articulate sounds had come from the
detached head as it lay in a shadowy corner of the laboratory. The shell had been
merciful, in a way — but West could never feel as certain as he wished, that we


two were the only survivors. He used to make shuddering conjectures about the
possible actions of a headless physician with the power of reanimating the dead.

West's last quarters were in a venerable house of much elegance, overlooking
one of the oldest burying- grounds in Boston. He had chosen the place for purely
symbolic and fantastically aesthetic reasons, since most of the interments were of
the colonial period and therefore of little use to a scientist seeking very fresh
bodies. The laboratory was in a sub-cellar secretly constructed by imported
workmen, and contained a huge incinerator for the quiet and complete disposal
of such bodies, or fragments and synthetic mockeries of bodies, as might remain
from the morbid experiments and unhallowed amusements of the owner. During
the excavation of this cellar the workmen had struck some exceedingly ancient
masonry; undoubtedly connected with the old burying-ground, yet far too deep
to correspond with any known sepulchre therein. After a number of calculations
West decided that it represented some secret chamber beneath the tomb of the
Averills, where the last interment had been made in 1768. I was with him when
he studied the nitrous, dripping walls laid bare by the spades and mattocks of
the men, and was prepared for the gruesome thrill which would attend the
uncovering of centuried grave-secrets; but for the first time West's new timidity
conquered his natural curiosity, and he betrayed his degenerating fibre by
ordering the masonry left intact and plastered over. Thus it remained till that
final hellish night; part of the walls of the secret laboratory. I speak of West's
decadence, but must add that it was a purely mental and intangible thing.
Outwardly he was the same to the last — calm, cold, slight, and yellow-haired,
with spectacled blue eyes and a general aspect of youth which years and fears
seemed never to change. He seemed calm even when he thought of that clawed
grave and looked over his shoulder; even when he thought of the carnivorous
thing that gnawed and pawed at Sefton bars.

The end of Herbert West began one evening in our joint study when he was
dividing his curious glance between the newspaper and me. A strange headline
item had struck at him from the crumpled pages, and a nameless titan claw had
seemed to reach down through sixteen years. Something fearsome and incredible
had happened at Sefton Asylum fifty miles away, stunning the neighbourhood
and baffling the police. In the small hours of the morning a body of silent men
had entered the grounds, and their leader had aroused the attendants. He was a
menacing military figure who talked without moving his lips and whose voice
seemed almost ventriloquially connected with an immense black case he carried.
His expressionless face was handsome to the point of radiant beauty, but had
shocked the superintendent when the hall light fell on it — for it was a wax face
with eyes of painted glass. Some nameless accident had befallen this man. A
larger man guided his steps; a repellent hulk whose bluish face seemed half
eaten away by some unknown malady. The speaker had asked for the custody of

the cannibal monster committed from Arkham sixteen years before; and upon
being refused, gave a signal which precipitated a shocking riot. The fiends had
beaten, trampled, and bitten every attendant who did not flee; killing four and
finally succeeding in the liberation of the monster. Those victims who could
recall the event without hysteria swore that the creatures had acted less like men
than like unthinkable automata guided by the wax-faced leader. By the time help
could be summoned, every trace of the men and of their mad charge had
vanished.

From the hour of reading this item until midmght. West sat almost paralysed. At
midnight the doorbell rang, startling him fearfully. All the servants were asleep
in the attic, so I answered the bell. As I have told the police, there was no wagon
in the street, but only a group of strange-looking figures bearing a large square
box which they deposited in the hallway after one of them had grunted in a
highly unnatural voice, "Express — prepaid." They filed out of the house with a
jerky tread, and as I watched them go I had an odd idea that they were turning
toward the ancient cemetery on which the back of the house abutted. When I
slammed the door after them West came downstairs and looked at the box. It
was about two feet square, and bore West's correct name and present address. It
also bore the inscription, "From Eric Moreland Clapham-Lee, St. Eloi, Flanders."
Six years before, in Flanders, a shelled hospital had fallen upon the headless
reanimated trunk of Dr. Clapham-Lee, and upon the detached head which —
perhaps — had uttered articulate sounds.

West was not even excited now. His condition was more ghastly. Quickly he
said, "It's the finish — but let's incinerate — this." We carried the thing down to
the laboratory — listening. I do not remember many particulars — you can
imagine my state of mind — but it is a vicious lie to say it was Herbert West's
body which I put into the incinerator. We both inserted the whole unopened
wooden box, closed the door, and started the electricity. Nor did any sound come
from the box, after all.

It was West who first noticed the falling plaster on that part of the wall where the
ancient tomb masonry had been covered up. I was going to run, but he stopped
me. Then I saw a small black aperture, felt a ghoulish wind of ice, and smelled
the charnel bowels of a putrescent earth. There was no sound, but just then the
electric lights went out and I saw outlined against some phosphorescence of the
nether world a horde of silent toiling things which only insanity — or worse —
could create. Their outlines were human, semi-human, fractionally human, and
not human at all — the horde was grotesquely heterogeneous. They were
removing the stones quietly, one by one, from the centuried wall. And then, as
the breach became large enough, they came out into the laboratory in single file;
led by a talking thing with a beautiful head made of wax. A sort of mad-eyed

monstrosity behind the leader seized on Herbert West. West did not resist or
utter a sound. Then they all sprang at him and tore him to pieces before my eyes,
bearing the fragments away into that subterranean vault of fabulous
abominations. West's head was carried off by the wax-headed leader, who wore
a Canadian officer's uniform. As it disappeared I saw that the blue eyes behind
the spectacles were hideously blazing with their first touch of frantic, visible
emotion.

Servants found me unconscious in the morning. West was gone. The incinerator
contained only unidentifiable ashes. Detectives have questioned me, but what
can I say? The Sefton tragedy they will not connect with West; not that, nor the
men with the box, whose existence they deny. I told them of the vault, and they
pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed. So I told them no more. They
imply that I am either a madman or a murderer — probably I am mad. But I
might not be mad if those accursed tomb- legions had not been so silent.


Imprisoned with the Pharaos

Written in March of 1924

Published in May of 1924 in Weird Tales

Mystery attracts mystery. Ever since the wide appearance of my name as a
performer of unexplained feats, I have encountered strange narratives and events
which my calling has led people to link with my interests and activities. Some of
these have been trivial and irrelevant, some deeply dramatic and absorbing,
some productive of weird and perilous experiences and some involving me in
extensive scientific and historical research. Many of these matters I have told and
shall continue to tell very freely; but there is one of which I speak with great
reluctance, and which I am now relating only after a session of grilling
persuasion from the publishers of this magazine, who had heard vague rumors
of it from other members of my family.

The hitherto guarded subject pertains to my non-professional visit to Egypt
fourteen years ago, and has been avoided by me for several reasons. For one
thing, I am averse to exploiting certain unmistakably actual facts and conditions
obviously unknown to the myriad tourists who throng about the pyramids and
apparently secreted with much diligence by the authorities at Cairo, who cannot
be wholly ignorant of them. For another thing, I dislike to recount an incident in
which my own fantastic imagination must have played so great a part. What I
saw - or thought I saw - certainly did not take place; but is rather to be viewed as
a result of my then recent readings in Egyptology, and of the speculations anent
this theme which my environment naturally prompted. These imaginative
stimuli, magnified by the excitement of an actual event terrible enough in itself,
undoubtedly gave rise to the culminating horror of that grotesque night so long
past.

In January, 1910, I had finished a professional engagement in England and
signed a contract for a tour of Australian theatres. A liberal time being allowed
for the trip, I determined to make the most of it in the sort of travel which chiefly
interests me; so accompanied by my wife I drifted pleasantly down the Continent
and embarked at Marseilles on the P & O Steamer Malwa, bound for Port Said.
From that point I proposed to visit the principal historical localities of lower
Egypt before leaving finally for Australia.

The voyage was an agreeable one, and enlivened by many of the amusing
incidents which befall a magical performer apart from his work. I had intended,
for the sake of quiet travel, to keep my name a secret; but was goaded into

betraying myself by a fellow-magician whose anxiety to astound the passengers
with ordinary tricks tempted me to duplicate and exceed his feats in a manner
quite destructive of my incognito. I mention this because of its ultimate effect - an
effect I should have foreseen before unmasking to a shipload of tourists about to
scatter throughout the Nile valley. What it did was to herald my identity
wherever I subsequently went, and deprive my wife and me of all the placid
inconspicuousness we had sought. Traveling to seek curiosities, I was often
forced to stand inspection as a sort of curiosity myself!

We had come to Egypt in search of the picturesque and the mystically
impressive, but found little enough when the ship edged up to Port Said and
discharged its passengers in small boats. Low dunes of sand, bobbing buoys in
shallow water, and a drearily European small town with nothing of interest save
the great De Lesseps statue, made us anxious to get to something more worth
our while. After some discussion we decided to proceed at once to Cairo and the
Pyramids, later going to Alexandria for the Australian boat and for whatever
Greco-Roman sights that ancient metropolis might present.

The railway journey was tolerable enough, and con sumed only four hours and a
half. We saw much of the Suez Canal, whose route we followed as far as
Ismailiya and later had a taste of Old Egypt in our glimpse of the restored fresh-
water canal of the Middle Empire. Then at last we saw Cairo glimmering
through the growing dusk; a winkling constellation which became a blaze as we
halted at the great Care Centrale.

But once more disappointment awaited us, for all that we beheld was European
save the costumes and the crowds. A prosaic subway led to a square teeming
with carriages, taxicabs, and trolley-cars and gorgeous with electric lights
shining on tall buildings; whilst the very theatre where I was vainly requested to
play and which I later attended as a spectator, had recently been renamed the
'American Cosmograph'. We stopped at Shepheard's Hotel, reached in a taxi that
sped along broad, smartly built-up streets; and amidst the perfect service of its
restaurant, elevators and generally Anglo-American luxuries the mysterious East
and immemorial past seemed very far away.

The next day, however, precipitated us delightfully into the heart of the Arabian
Nights atmosphere; and in the winding ways and exotic skyline of Cairo, the
Bagdad of Harun-al-Rashid seemed to live again. Guided by our Baedeker, we
had struck east past the Ezbekiyeh Gardens along the Mouski in quest of the
native quarter, and were soon in the hands of a clamorous cicerone who -
notwith standing later developments - was assuredly a master at his trade.


Not until afterward did I see that I should have applied at the hotel for a licensed
guide. This man, a shaven, peculiarly hollow-voiced and relatively cleanly fellow
who looked like a Pharaoh and called himself 'Abdul Reis el Drogman' appeared
to have much power over others of his kind; though subsequently the police
professed not to know him, and to suggest that reis is merely a name for any
person in authority, whilst 'Drogman' is obviously no more than a clumsy
modification of the word for a leader of tourist parties - dragoman.

Abdul led us among such wonders as we had before only read and dreamed of.
Old Cairo is itself a story-book and a dream - labyrinths of narrow alleys
redolent of aromatic secrets; Arabesque balconies and oriels nearly meeting
above the cobbled streets; maelstroms of Oriental traffic with strange cries,
cracking whips, rattling carts, jingling money, and braying donkeys;
kaleidoscopes of polychrome robes, veils, turbans, and tarbushes; water-carriers
and dervishes, dogs and cats, soothsayers and barbers; and over all the whining
of blind beggars crouched in alcoves, and the sonorous chanting of muezzins
from minarets limned delicately against a sky of deep, unchanging blue.

The roofed, quieter bazaars were hardly less alluring. Spice, perfume, incense
beads, rugs, silks, and brass - old Mahmoud Suleiman squats cross-legged
amidst his gummy bottles while chattering youths pulverize mustard in the
hoUowed-out capital of an ancient classic column - a Roman Corinthian, perhaps
from neighboring Heliopolis, where Augustus stationed one of his three
Egyptian legions. Antiquity begins to mingle with exoticism. And then the
mosques and the museum - we saw them all, and tried not to let our Arabian
revel succumb to the darker charm of Pharaonic Egypt which the museum's
priceless treasures offered. That was to be our climax, and for the present we
concentrated on the mediaeval Saracenic glories of the Califs whose magnificent
tomb-mosques form a glittering faery necropolis on the edge of the Arabian
Desert.

At length Abdul took us along the Sharia Mohammed Ali to the ancient mosque
of Sultan Hassan, and the tower-flanked Babel-Azab, beyond which climbs the
steep-walled pass to the mighty citadel that Saladin himself built with the stones
of forgotten pyramids. It was sunset when we scaled that cliff, circled the
modern mosque of Mohammed Ali, and looked down from the dizzy parapet
over mystic Cairo - mystic Cairo all golden with its carven domes, its ethereal
minarets and its flaming gardens.

Far over the city towered the great Roman dome of the new museum; and
beyond it - across the cryptic yellow Nile that is the mother of eons and dynasties
- lurked the menacing sands of the Libyan Desert, undulant and iridesc ent and
evil with older arcana.

The red sun sank low, bringing the relentless chill of Egyptian dusk; and as it
stood poised on the world's rim like that ancient god of Heliopolis - Re-
Harakhte, the Horizon-Sun - we saw silhouetted against its vermeil holocaust the
black outlines of the Pyramids of Gizeh - the palaeogean tombs there were hoary
with a thousand years when Tut-Ankh-Amen mounted his golden throne in
distant Thebes. Then we knew that we were done with Saracen Cairo, and that
we must taste the deeper mysteries of primal Egypt - the black Kem of Re and
Amen, Isis and Osiris.

The next morning we visited the Pyramids, riding out in a Victoria across the
island of Chizereh with its massive lebbakh trees, and the smaller English bridge
to the western shore. Down the shore road we drove, between great rows of
lebbakhs and past the vast Zoological Gardens to the suburb of Gizeh, where a
new bridge to Cairo proper has since been built. Then, turning inland along the
Sharia-el-Haram, we crossed a region of glassy canals and shabby native villages
till before us loomed the objects of our quest, cleaving the mists of dawn and
forming inverted replicas in the roadside pools. Forty centuries, as Napoleon had
told his campaigners there, indeed looked down upon us.

The road now rose abruptly, till we finally reached our place of transfer between
the trolley station and the Mena House Hotel. Abdul Reis, who capably
purchased our Pyramid tickets, seemed to have an understanding with the
crowding, yelling and offensive Bedouins who inhabited a squalid mud village
some distance away and pestiferously assailed every traveler; for he kept them
very decently at bay and secured an excellent pair of camels for us, himself
mounting a donkey and assigning the leadership of our animals to a group of
men and boys more expensive than useful. The area to be traversed was so small
that camels were hardly needed, but we did not regret adding to our experience
this troublesome form of desert navigation.

The pyramids stand on a high rock plateau, this group forming next to the
northernmost of the series of regal and aristocratic cemeteries built in the
neighborhood of the extinct capital Memphis, which lay on the same side of the
Nile, somewhat south of Gizeh, and which flourished between 3400 and 2000
B.C. The greatest pyramid, which lies nearest the modern road, was built by King
Cheops or Khufu about 2800 B.C., and stands more than 450 feet in
perpendicular height. In a line southwest from this are successively the Second
Pyramid, built a generation later by King Khephren, and though slightly smaller,
looking even larger because set on higher ground, and the radically smaller
Third Pyramid of King Mycerinus, built about 2700 B.C. Near the edge of the
plateau and due east of the Second Pyramid, with a face probably altered to form
a colossal portrait of Khephren, its royal restorer, stands the monstrous Sphinx -
mute, sardonic, and wise beyond mankind and memory.

Minor pyramids and the traces of ruined minor pyramids are found in several
places, and the whole plateau is pitted with the tombs of dignitaries of less than
royal rank. These latter were originally marked by mastabas, or stone bench- like
structures about the deep burial shafts, as found in other Memphian cemeteries
and exemplified by Perneb's Tomb in the Metropolitan Museum of New York.
At Gizeb, however, all such visible things have been swept away by time and
pillage; and only the rock-hewn shafts, either sand-filled or cleared out by
archaeologists, remain to attest their former existence. Connected with each tomb
was a chapel in which priests and relatives offered food and prayer to the
hovering ka or vital principle of the deceased. The small tombs have their
chapels contained in their stone mastabas or superstructures, but the mortuary
chapels of the pyramids, where regal Pharaohs lay, were separate temples, each
to the east of its corresponding pyramid, and connec ted by a causeway to a
massive gate-chapel or propylon at the edge of the rock plateau.

The gate-chapel leading to the Second Pyramid, nearly buried in the drifting
sands, yawns subterraneously south-east of the Sphinx. Persistent tradition dubs
it the 'Temple of the Sphinx'; and it may perhaps be rightly called such if the
Sphinx indeed represents the Second Pyramid's builder Khephren. There are
unpleasant tales of the Sphinx before Khephren - but whatever its elder features
were, the monarch replaced them with his own that men might look at the
colossus without fear.

It was in the great gateway-temple that the life-size diorite statue of Khephren
now in the Cairo museum was found; a statue before which I stood in awe when
I beheld it. Whether the whole edifice is now excavated I am not certain, but in
1910 most of it was below ground, with the entrance heavily barred at night.
Germans were in charge of the work, and the war or other things may have
stopped them. I would give much, in view of my experience and of certain
Bedouin whisperings discredited or unknown in Cairo, to know what has
developed in connection with a certain well in a transverse gallery where statues
of the Pharaoh were found in curious juxtaposition to the statues of baboons.

The road, as we traversed it on our camels that morning, curved sharply past the
wooden police quarters, post office, drug store and shops on the left, and
plunged south and east in a complete bend that scaled the rock plateau and
brought us face to face with the desert under the lee of the Great Pyramid. Past
Cyclopean masonry we rode, rounding the eastern face and looking down ahead
into a valley of minor pyramids beyond which the eternal Nile glistened to the
east, and the eternal desert shimmered to the west. Very close loomed the three
major pyramids, the greatest devoid of outer casing and showing its bulk of
great stones, but the others retaining here and there the neatly fitted covering
which had made them smooth and finished in their day.

Presently we descended toward the Sphinx, and sat silent beneath the spell of
those terrible unseeing eyes. On the vast stone breast we faintly discerned the
emblem of Re-Harakhte, for whose image the Sphinx was mistaken in a late
dynasty; and though sand covered the tablet between the great paws, we recalled
what Thutmosis IV inscribed thereon, and the dream he had when a prince. It
was then that the smile of the Sphinx vaguely displeased us, and made us
wonder about the legends of subterranean pas sages beneath the monstrous
creature, leading down, down, to depths none might dare hint at - depths
connected with mysteries older than the dynastic Egypt we excavate, and having
a sinister relation to the persistence of abnormal, animal-headed gods in the
ancient Nilotic pantheon. Then, too, it was I asked myself in idle question whose
hideous significance was not to appear for many an hour.

Other tourists now began to overtake us, and we moved on to the sand-choked
Temple of the Sphinx, fifty yards to the southeast, which I have previously
mentioned as the great gate of the causeway to the Second Pyramid's mortuary
chapel on the plateau. Most of it was still underground, and although we
dismounted and descended through a modern passageway to its alabaster
corridor and pillared hall, I felt that Adul and the local German attendant had
not shown us all there was to see.

After this we made the conventional circuit of the pyramid plateau, examining
the Second Pyramid and the peculiar ruins of its mortuary chapel to the east, the
Third Pyramid and its miniature southern satellites and ruined eastern chapel,
the rock tombs and the honeycombings of the Fourth and Fifth dynasties, and the
famous Campbell's Tomb whose shadowy shaft sinks precipitously for fifty-
three feet to a sinister sarcophagus which one of our camel drivers divested of
the cumbering sand after a vertiginous descent by rope.

Cries now assailed us from the Great Pyramid, where Bedouins were besieging a
party of tourists with offers of speed in the performance of solitary trips up and
down. Seven minutes is said to be the record for such an ascent and descent, but
many lusty sheiks and sons of sheiks assured us they could cut it to five if given
the requisite impetus of liberal baksheesh. They did not get this impetus, though
we did let Abdul take us up, thus obtaining a view of unprecedented
magnificence which included not only remote and glittering Cairo with its
crowned citadel back ground of gold-violet hills, but all the pyramids of the
Memphian district as well, from Abu Roash on the north to the Dashur on the
south. The Sakkara step-pyramid, which marks the evolution of the low mastaba
into the true pyramid, showed clearly and alluringly in the sandy distance. It is
close to this transition-monument that the famed :omb of Perneb was found -
more than four hundred miles orth of the Theban rock valley where Tut-Ankh-
Amen sleeps. Again I was forced to silence through sheer awe. The prospect of



such antiquity, and the secrets each hoary monument seemed to hold and brood
over, filled me with a reverence and sense of immensity nothing else ever gave
me.

Fatigued by our climb, and disgusted with the importunate Bedouins whose
actions seemed to defy every rule of taste, we omitted the arduous detail of
entering the cramped interior passages of any of the pyramids, though we saw
several of the hardiest tourists preparing for the suffocating crawl through
Cheops' mightiest memorial. As we dismissed and overpaid our local bodyguard
and drove back to Cairo with Abdul Reis under the afternoon sun, we half
regretted the omission we had made. Such fascinating things were whispered
about lower pyramid pas sages not in the guide books; passages whose entrances
had been hastily blocked up and concealed by certain uncommunicative
archaeologists who had found and begun to explore them.

Of course, this whispering was largely baseless on the face of it; but it was
curious to reflect how persistently visitors were forbidden to enter the Pyramids
at night, or to visit the lowest burrows and crypt of the Great Pyramid. Perhaps
in the latter case it was the psychological effect which was feared - the effect on
the visitor of feeling himself huddled down beneath a gigantic world of solid
masonry; joined to the life he has known by the merest tube, in which he may
only crawl, and which any accident or evil design might block. The whole subject
seemed so weird and alluring that we resolved to pay the pyramid plateau
another visit at the earliest possible opportun ity. For me this opportunity came
much earlier than I expected.

That evening, the members of our party feeling some what tired after the
strenuous program of the day, I went alone with Abdul Reis for a walk through
the picturesque Arab quarter. Though I had seen it by day, I wished to study the
alleys and bazaars in the dusk, when rich shadows and mellow gleams of light
would add to their glamor and fantastic illusion. The native crowds were
thinning, but were still very noisy and numerous when we came upon a knot of
reveling Bedouins in the Suken-Nahhasin, or bazaar of the coppersmiths. Their
apparent leader, an insolent youth with heavy features and saucily cocked
tarbush, took some notice of us, and evidently recognized with no great
friendliness my competent but admittedly supercilious and sneeringly disposed
guide.

Perhaps, I thought, he resented that odd reproduction of the Sphinx's half-smile
which I had often remarked with amused irritation; or perhaps he did not like
the hollow and sepulchral resonance of Abdul's voice. At any rate, the exchange
of ancestrally opprobrious language became very brisk; and before long Ali Ziz,
as I heard the stranger called when called by no worse name, began to pull



violently at Abdul's robe, an action quickly reciprocated and leading to a spirited
scuffle in which both combatants lost their sacredly cherished headgear and
would have reached an even direr condition had I not intervened and separated
them by main force.

My interference, at first seemingly unwelcome on both sides, succeeded at last in
effecting a truce. Sullenly each belligerent composed his wrath and his attire, and
with an assumption of dignity as profound as it was sudden, the two formed a
curious pact of honor which I soon learned is a custom of great antiquity in Cairo
- a pact for the settle ment of their difference by means of a nocturnal fist fight
atop the Great Pyramid, long after the departure of the last moon light sightseer.
Each duelist was to assemble a party of seconds, and the affair was to begin at
midnight, proceeding by rounds in the most civilized possible fashion.

In all this planning there was much which excited my interest. The fight itself
promised to be unique and spectacular, while the thought of the scene on that
hoary pile overlooking the antediluvian plateau of Gizeh under the wan moon of
the pallid small hours appealed to every fiber of imagination in me. A request
found Abdul exceedingly willing to admit me to his party of seconds; so that all
the rest of the early evening I accompanied him to various dens in the most
lawless regions of the town - mostly northeast of the Ezbekiyeh - where he
gathered one by one a select and formidable band of congenial cutthroats as his
pugilistic background.

Shortly after nine our party, mounted on donkeys bearing such royal or tourist-
reminiscent names as 'Rameses,' 'Mark Twain,' 'J. P. Morgan,' and 'Minnehaha',
edged through street labyrinths both Oriental and Occidental, crossed the
muddy and mast-forested Nile by the bridge of the bronze lions, and cantered
philosophically between the lebbakhs on the road to Gizeh. Slightly over two
hours were consumed by the trip, toward the end of which we passed the last of
the returning tourists, saluted the last inbound trolley-car, and were alone with
the night and the past and the spectral moon.

Then we saw the vast pyramids at the end of the avenue, ghoulish with a dim
atavistical menace which I had not seemed to notice in the daytime. Even the
smallest of them held a hint of the ghastly -for was it not in this that they had
buried Queen Nitocris alive in the Sixth Dynasty; subtle Queen Nitocris, who
once invited all her enemies to a feast in a temple below the Nile, and drowned
them by opening the water-gates? I recalled that the Arabs whisper things about
Nitocris, and shun the Third Pyramid at certain phases of the moon. It must have
been over her that Thomas Moore was brooding when he wrote a thing muttered
about by Memphian boatmen:

'The subterranean nymph that dwells

'Mid sunless gems and glories hid

The lady of the Pyramid!'

Early as we were, Ali Ziz and his party were ahead of us; for we saw their
donkeys outlined against the desert plateau at Kafrel-Haram; toward which
squalid Arab settlement, close to the Sphinx, we had diverged instead of
following the regular road to the Mena House, where some of the sleepy,
inefficient police might have observed and halted us. Here, where filthy
Bedouins stabled camels and donkeys in the rock tombs of Khephren's courtiers,
we were led up the rocks and over the sand to the Great Pyramid, up whose
time-worn sides the Arabs swarmed eagerly, Abdul Reis offering me the
assistance I did not need.

As most travelers know, the actual apex of this structure has long been worn
away, leaving a reasonably flat platform twelve yards square. On this eery
pinnacle a squared circle was formed, and in a few moments the sardonic desert
moon leered down upon a battle which, but for the quality of the ringside cries,
might well have occurred at some minor athletic club in America. As I watched
it, I felt that some of our less -desirable institutions were not lacking; for every
blow, feint, and defense bespoke 'stalling' to my not inexperienced eye. It was
quickly over, and despite my misgivings as to methods I felt a sort of proprietary
pride when Abdul Reis was adjudged the winner.

Reconciliation was phenomenally rapid, and amidst the singing, fraternizing and
drinking that followed, I found it difficult to realize that a quarrel had ever
occurred. Oddly enough, I myself seemed to be more a center of notice than the
antagonists; and from my smattering of Arabic I judged that they were
discussing my professional performances and escapes from every sort of manacle
and confinement, in a manner which indicated not only a surprising knowledge
of me, but a distinct hostility and skepticism concerning my feats of escape. It
gradually dawned on me that the elder magic of Egypt did not depart without
leaving traces, and that fragments of a strange secret lore and priestly cult
practises have survived surreptitiously amongst the fella heen to such an extent
that the prowess of a strange hahwi or magician is resented and disputed. I
thought of how much my hollow-voiced guide Abdul Reis looked like an old
Egyptian priest or Pharaoh or smiling Sphinx . . . and wondered.

Suddenly something happened which in a flash proved the correctness of my
reflections and made me curse the denseness whereby I had accepted this night's
events as other than the empty and malicious 'frame-up' they now showed
themselves to be. Without warning, and doubtless in answer to some subtle sign
from Abdul, the entire band of Bedouins precipitated itself upon me; and having

produced heavy ropes, soon had me bound as securely as I was ever bound in
the course of my Hfe, either on the stage or off.

I struggled at first, but soon saw that one man could make no headway against a
band of over twenty sinewy barbarians. My hands were tied behind my back, my
knees bent to their fullest extent, and my wrists and ankles stoutly linked
together with unyielding cords. A stifling gag was forced into my mouth, and a
blindfold fastened tightly over my eyes. Then, as Arabs bore me aloft on their
shoulders and began a jouncing descent of the pyramid, I heard the taunts of my
late guide Abdul, who mocked and jeered delightedly in his hollow voice, and
assured me that I was soon to have my 'magic -powers' put to a supreme test -
which would quickly remove any egotism I might have gained through
triumphing over all the tests offered by America and Europe. Egypt, he
reminded me, is very old, and full of inner mysteries and antique powers not
even conceivable to the experts of today, whose devices had so uniformly failed
to entrap me.

How far or in what direction I was carried, I cannot tell; for the circumstances
were all against the formation of any accurate judgment. I know, however, that it
could not have been a great distance; since my bearers at no point hastened
beyond a walk, yet kept me aloft a surprisingly short time. It is this perplexing
brevity which makes me feel almost like shuddering whenever I think of Gizeh
and its plateau - for one is oppressed by hints of the closeness to everyday tourist
routes of what existed then and must exist still.

The evil abnormality I speak of did not become manifest at first. Setting me
down on a surface which I recognized as sand rather than rock, my captors
passed a rope around my chest and dragged me a few feet to a ragged opening in
the ground, into which they presently lowered me with much rough handling.
For apparent eons I bumped against the stony irregular sides of a narrow hewn
well which I took to be one of the numerous burial-shafts of the plateau until the
prodigious, almost incredible depth of it robbed me of all bases of conjecture.

The horror of the experience deepened with every dragging second. That any
descent through the sheer solid rock could be so vast without reaching the core
of the planet itself, or that any rope made by man could be so long as to dangle
me in these unholy and seemingly fathomless pro fundities of nether earth, were
beliefs of such grotesqueness that it was easier to doubt my agitated senses than
to accept them. Even now I am uncertain, for I know how deceitful the sense of
time becomes when one is removed or distorted. But I am quite sure that I
preserved a logical consciousness that far; that at least I did not add any
fullgrown phantoms of imagination to a picture hideous enough in its reality,
and explicable by a type of cerebral illusion vastly short of actual hallucination.


All this was not the cause of my first bit of fainting. The shocking ordeal was
cumulative, and the beginning of the later terrors was a very perceptible increase
in my rate of descent. They were paying out that infinitely long rope very swiftly
now, and I scraped cruelly against the rough and constricted sides of the shaft as
I shot madly downward. My clothing was in tatters, and I felt the trickle of blood
all over, even above the mounting and excruciating pain. My nostrils, too, were
assailed by a scarcely definable menace: a creeping odor of damp and staleness
curiously unlike anything I had ever smelled before, and having faint overtones
of spice and incense that lent an element of mockery.

Then the mental cataclysm came. It was horrible - hideous beyond all articulate
description because it was all of the soul, with nothing of detail to describe. It
was the ecstasy of nightmare and the summation of the fiendish. The suddenness
of it was apocalyptic and demoniac - one moment I was plunging agonizingly
down that narrow well of million-toothed torture, yet the next moment I was
soaring on bat-wings in the gulfs of hell; swinging free and swooping through
illimitable miles of boundless, musty space; rising dizzily to measureless
pinnacles of chilling ether, then diving gaspingly to sucking nadirs of ravenous,
nauseous lower vacua ... Thank God for the mercy that shut out in oblivion
those clawing Furies of consciousness which half unhinged my faculties, and tore
harpy-like at my spirit! That one respite, short as it was, gave me the strength
and sanity to endure those still greater sublima tions of cosmic panic that lurked
and gibbered on the road ahead.

II

It was very gradually that I regained my senses after that eldritch flight through
Stygian space. The process was infinitely painful, and colored by fantastic
dreams in which my bound and gagged condition found singular embodiment.
The precise nature of these dreams was very clear while I was experiencing
them, but became blurred in my recollection almost immediately afterward, and
was soon reduced to the merest outline by the terrible events - real or imaginary -
which followed. I dreamed that I was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw; a
yellow, hairy, five- clawed paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and
engulf me. And when I stopped to reflect what the paw was, it seemed to me that
it was Egypt. In the dream I looked back at the events of the preceding weeks,
and saw myself lured and enmeshed little by little, subtly and insidiously, by
some hellish ghoul-spirit of the elder Nile sorcery; some spirit that was in Egypt
before ever man was, and that will be when man is no more.

I saw the horror and unwholesome antiquity of Egypt, and the grisly alliance it
has always had with the tombs and temples of the dead. I saw phantom
processions of priests with the heads of bulls, falcons, cats, and ibises; phantom
processions marching interminably through subterraneous labyrinths and


avenues of titanic propylaea beside which a man is as a fly, and offering
unnamable sacrifice to indescribable gods. Stone colossi marched in endless
night and drove herds of grinning androsphinxes down to the shores of
illimitable stagnant rivers of pitch. And behind it all I saw the ineffable malignity
of primordial necromancy, black and amorphous, and fumbling greedily after
me in the darkness to choke out the spirit that had dared to mock it by
emulation.

In my sleeping brain there took shape a melodrama of sinister hatred and
pursuit, and I saw the black soul of Egypt singling me out and calling me in
inaudible whispers; calling and luring me, leading me on with the glitter and
glamor of a Saracenic surface, but ever pulling me down to the age-mad
catacombs and horrors of its dead and abysmal pharaonic heart.

Then the dream faces took on human resemblances, and I saw my guide Abdul
Reis in the robes of a king, with the sneer of the Sphinx on his features. And I
knew that those features were the features of Khephren the Great, who raised the
Second Pyramid, carved over the Sphinx's face in the likeness of his own and
built that titanic gateway temple whose myriad corridors the archaeologists
think they have dug out of the cryptical sand and the uninformative rock. And I
looked at the long, lean rigid hand of Khephren; the long, lean, rigid hand as I
had seen it on the diorite statue in the Cairo Museum - the statue they had found
in the terrible gateway temple - and wondered that I had not shrieked when I
saw it on Abdul Reis... That hand! It was hideously cold, and it was crushing
me; it was the cold and cramping of the sarcophagus . . . the chill and constriction
of unrememberable Egypt... It was nighted, necropolitan Egypt itself.., that
yellow paw. .. and they whisper such things of Khephren. . .

But at this juncture I began to wake - or at least, to assume a condition less
completely that of sleep than the one just preceding. I recalled the fight atop the
pyramid, the treacherous Bedouins and their attack, my frightful descent by rope
through endless rock depths, and my mad swinging and plunging in a chill void
redolent of aromatic putrescence. I perceived that I now lay on a damp rock
floor, and that my bonds were still biting into me with unloosened force. It was
very cold, and I seemed to detect a faint current of noisome air sweeping across
me. The cuts and bruises I had received from the jagged sides of the rock shaft
were paining me woefully, their soreness enhanced to a stinging or burning
acuteness by some pungent quality in the faint draft, and the mere act of rolling
over was enough to set my whole frame throbbing with untold agony.

As I turned I felt a tug from above, and concluded that the rope whereby I was
lowered still reached to the surface. Whether or not the Arabs still held it, I had
no idea; nor had I any idea how far within the earth I was. I knew that the


darkness around me was wholly or nearly total, since no ray of moonlight
penetrated my blindfold; but I did not trust my senses enough to accept as
evidence of extreme depth the sensation of vast duration which had
characterized my descent.

Knowing at least that I was in a space of considerable extent reached from the
above surface directly by an opening in the rock, I doubtfully conjectured that
my prison was perhaps the buried gateway chapel of old Khephren - the Temple
of the Sphinx - perhaps some inner corridors which the guides had not shown
me during my morning visit, and from which I might easily escape if I could find
my way to the barred entrance. It would be a labyrinthine wandering, but no
worse than others out of which I had in the past found my way.

The first step was to get free of my bonds, gag, and blindfold; and this I knew
would be no great task, since subtler experts than these Arabs had tried every
known species of fetter upon me during my long and varied career as an
exponent of escape, yet had never succeeded in defeating my methods.

Then it occurred to me that the Arabs might be ready to meet and attack me at
the entrance upon any evidence of my probable escape from the binding cords,
as would be furnished by any decided agitation of the rope which they probably
held. This, of course, was taking for granted that my place of confinement was
indeed Khephren's Temple of the Sphinx. The direct opening in the roof,
wherever it might lurk, could not be beyond easy reach of the ordinary modern
entrance near the Sphinx; if in truth it were any great distance at all on the
surface, since the total area known to visitors is not at all enormous. I had not
noticed any such opening during my daytime pilgrimage, but knew that these
things are easily overlooked amidst the drifting sands.

Thinking these matters over as I lay bent and bound on the rock floor, I nearly
forgot the horrors of abysmal descent and cavernous swinging which had so
lately reduced me to a coma. My present thought was only to outwit the Arabs,
and I accordingly determined to work myself free as quickly as possible,
avoiding any tug on the descending line which might betray an effective or even
problematical attempt at freedom.

This, however, was more easily determined than effected. A few preliminary
trials made it clear that little could be accomplished without considerable
motion; and it did not surprise me when, after one especially energetic struggle, I
began to feel the coils of falling rope as they piled up about me and upon me.
Obviously, I thought, the Bedouins had felt my movements and released their
end of the rope; hastening no doubt to the temple's true entrance to lie
murderously in wait for me.


The prospect was not pleasing - but I had faced worse in my time without
flinching, and would not flinch now. At present I must first of all free myself of
bonds, then trust to ingenuity to escape from the temple unharmed. It is curious
how implicitly I had come to believe myself in the old temple of Khephren beside
the Sphinx, only a short dis tance below the ground.

That belief was shattered, and every pristine apprehen sion of preternattiral
depth and demoniac mystery revived, by a circumstance which grew in horror
and significance even as I formulated my philosophical plan. I have said that the
falling rope was piling up about and upon me. Now I saw that it was continuing
to pile, as no rope of normal length could possibly do. It gained in momentum
and became an avalanche of hemp, accumulating moun tainously on the floor
and half burying me beneath its swiftly multiplying coils. Soon I was completely
engulfed and gasping for breath as the increasing convolutions submerged and
stifled me.

My senses tottered again, and I vaguely tried to fight off a menace desperate and
ineluctable. It was not merely that I was tortured beyond human endurance - not
merely that life and breath seemed to be crushed slowly out of me - it was the
knowledge of what those unnatural lengths of rope implied, and the
consciousness of what unknown and incalculable gulfs of inner earth must at this
moment be surrounding me. My endless descent and swinging flight through
goblin space, then, must have been real, and even now I must be lying helpless in
some nameless cavern world toward the core of the planet. Such a sudden
confirmation of ultimate horror was insupportable, and a second time I lapsed
into merciful oblivion.

When I say oblivion, I do not imply that I was free from dreams. On the contrary,
my absence from the conscious world was marked by visions of the most
unutterable hideousness. God! ... If only I had not read so much Egyptology
before coming to this land which is the fountain of all darkness and terror! This
second spell of fainting filled my sleeping mind anew with shivering realization
of the country and its archaic secrets, and through some damnable chance my
dreams turned to the ancient notions of the dead and their sojournings in soul
and body beyond those mysterious tombs which were more houses than graves.
I recalled, in dream-shapes which it is well that I do not remember, the peculiar
and elaborate construction of Egyptian sepulchers; and the exceedingly singular
and terrific doctrines which determined this construction.

All these people thought of was death and the dead. They conceived of a literal
resurrection of the body which made them mummify it with desperate care, and
preserve all the vital organs in canopic jars near the corpse; whilst besides the
body they believed in two other elements, the soul, which after its weighing and


approval by Osiris dwelt in the land of the blest, and the obscure and portentous
ka or life-principle which wandered about the upper and lower worlds in a
horrible way, demanding occasional access to the preserved body, consuming
the food offerings brought by priests and pious relatives to the mortuary chapel,
and sometimes - as men whispered - taking its body or the wooden double
always buried beside it and stalking noxiously abroad on errands peculiarly
repellent.

For thousands of years those bodies rested gorgeously encased and staring
glassily upward when not visited by the ka, awaiting the day when Osiris should
restore both ka and soul, and lead forth the stiff legions of the dead from the
sunken houses of sleep. It was to have been a glorious rebirth - but not all souls
were approved, nor were all tombs inviolate, so that certain grotesque mistakes
and fiendish abnormalities were to be looked for. Even today the Arabs murmur
of unsanctified convocations and unwholesome worship in forgotten nether
abysses, which only winged invisible kas and soulless mummies may visit and
return unscathed.

Perhaps the most leeringly blood-congealing legends are those which relate to
certain perverse products of decadent priestcraft - composite mummies made by
the artificial union of human trunks and limbs with the heads of animals in
imitation of the elder gods. At all stages of history the sacred animals were
mummified, so that consecrated bulls, cats, ibises, crocodiles and the like might
return some day to greater glory. But only in the decadence did they mix the
human and the animal in the same mummy - only in the decadence, when they
did not understand the rights and prerogatives of the ka and the soul.

What happened to those composite mummies is not told of- at least publicly -
and it is certain that no Egyptologist ever found one. The whispers of Arabs are
very wild, and cannot be relied upon. They even hint that old Khephren - he of
the Sphinx, the Second Pyramid and the yawning gateway temple - lives far
underground wedded to the ghoul-queen Nitocris and ruling over the mummies
that are neither of man nor of beast.

It was of these - of Khephren and his consort and his strange armies of the hybrid
dead - that I dreamed, and that is why I am glad the exact dream-shapes have
faded from my memory. My most horrible vision was connected with an idle
question I had asked myself the day before when looking at the great carven
riddle of the desert and wondering with what unknown depth the temple close
to it might be secretly connected. That question, so innocent and whimsical then,
assumed in my dream a meaning of frenetic and hysterical madness ... what
huge and loathsome abnormality was the Sphinx originally carven to represent?


My second awakening - if awakening it was - is a memory of stark hideousness
which nothing else in my Hfe - save one thing which came after - can parallel;
and that life has been full and adventurous beyond most men's. Remember that I
had lost consciousness whilst buried beneath a cascade of falling rope whose
immensity revealed the cataclysmic depth of my present position. Now, as
perception returned, I felt the entire weight gone; and realized upon rolling over
that although I was still tied, gagged and blindfolded, some agency had removed
completely the suffocating hempen landslide which had overwhelmed me. The
significance of this condition, of course, came to me only gradually; but even so I
think it would have brought unconsciousness again had I not by this time
reached such a state of emotional exhaustion that no new horror could make
much difference. I was alone. . . with what?

Before I could torture myself with any new reflection, or make any fresh effort to
escape from my bonds, an additional circumstance became manifest. Pains not
formerly felt were racking my arms and legs, and I seemed coated with a
profusion of dried blood beyond anything my former cuts and abrasions could
furnish. My chest, too, seemed pierced by a hundred wounds, as though some
malign, titanic ibis had been pecking at it. Assuredly the agency which had
removed the rope was a hostile one, and had begun to wreak terrible injuries
upon me when somehow impelled to desist. Yet at the same time my sensations
were distinctly the reverse of what one might expect. Instead of sinking into a
bottomless pit of despair, I was stirred to a new courage and action; for now I felt
that the evil forces were physical things which a fearless man might encounter on
an even basis.

On the strength of this thought I tugged again at my bonds, and used all the art
of a lifetime to free myself as I had so often done amidst the glare of lights and
the applause of vast crowds. The familiar details of my escaping process
commenced to engross me, and now that the long rope was gone I half regained
my belief that the supreme horrors were hallucinations after all, and that there
had never been any terrible shaft, measureless abyss or interminable rope. Was I
after all in the gateway temple of Khephren beside the Sphinx, and had the
sneaking Arabs stolen in to torture me as I lay helpless there? At any rate, I must
be free. Let me stand up unbound, ungagged, and with eyes open to catch any
glimmer of light which might come trickling from any source, and I could
actually delight in the combat against evil and treacherous foes!

How long I took in shaking off my encumbrances I cannot tell. It must have been
longer than in my exhibition performances, because I was wounded, exhausted,
and enervated by the experiences I had passed through. When I was finally free,
and taking deep breaths of a chill, damp, evilly spiced air all the more horrible
when encountered without the screen of gag and blindfold edges, I found that I


was too cramped and fatigued to move at once. There I lay, trying to stretch a
frame bent and mangled, for an indefinite period, and straining my eyes to catch
a glimpse of some ray of light which would give a hint as to my position.

By degrees my strength and flexibility returned, but my eyes beheld nothing. As
I staggered to my feet I peered diligently in every direction, yet met only an
ebony blackness as great as that I had known when blindfolded. I tried my legs,
blood-encrusted beneath my shredded trousers, and found that I could walk; yet
could not decide in what direction to go. Obviously I ought not to walk at
random, and perhaps retreat directly from the entrance I sought; so I paused to
note the difference of the cold, fetid, natron-scented air-current which I had
never ceased to feel. Accepting the point of its source as the possible entrance to
the abyss, I strove to keep track of this landmark and to walk consistently toward
it.

I had a match-box with me, and even a small electric flashlight; but of course the
pockets of my tossed and tattered clothing were long since emptied of all heavy
articles. As I walked cautiously in the blackness, the draft grew stronger and
more offensive, till at length I could regard it as nothing less than a tangible
stream of detestable vapor pouring out of some aperture like the smoke of the
genie from the fisherman's jar in the Eastern tale. The East . . . Egypt . . . truly, this
dark cradle of civilization was ever the wellspring of horrors and marvels
unspeakable!

The more I reflected on the nature of this cavern wind, the greater my sense of
disquiet became; for although despite its odor I had sought its source as at least
an indirect clue to the outer world, I now saw plainly that this foul emanation
could have no admixture or connection whatsoever with the clean air of the
Libyan Desert, but must be essentially a thing vomited from sinister gulfs still
lower down. I had, then, been walking in the wrong direction!

After a moment's reflection I decided not to retrace my steps. Away from the
draft I would have no landmarks, for the roughly level rock floor was devoid of
distinctive configurations. If, however, I followed up the strange current, I would
undoubtedly arrive at an aperture of some sort, from whose gate I could perhaps
work round the walls to the opposite side of this Cyclopean and otherwise
unnavigable hall. That I might fail, I well realized. I saw that this was no part of
Khephren's gateway temple which tourists know, and it struck me that this
particular hall might be unknown even to archaeologists, and merely stumbled
upon by the inquisitive and malignant Arabs who had imprisoned me. If so, was
there any present gate of escape to the known parts or to the outer air?



What evidence, indeed, did I now possess that this was the gateway temple at
all? For a moment all my wildest speculations rushed back upon me, 'and I
thought of that vivid melange of impressions - descent, suspension in space, the
rope, my wounds, and the dreams that were frankly dreams. Was this the end of
life for me? Or indeed, would it be merciful if this moment were the end? I could
answer none of my own questions, but merely kept on, till Fate for a third time
reduced me to oblivion.

This time there were no dreams, for the suddenness of the incident shocked me
out of all thought either conscious or subconscious. Tripping on an unexpected
descending step at a point where the offensive draft became strong enough to
offer an actual physical resistance, I was precipitated headlong down a black
flight of huge stone stairs into a gulf of hideousness unrelieved.

That I ever breathed again is a tribute to the inherent vitality of the healthy
human organism. Often I look back to that night and feel a touch of actual humor
in those repeated lapses of consciousness; lapses whose succession reminded me
at the time of nothing more than the crude cinema melodramas of that period. Of
course, it is possible that the repeated lapses never occurred; and that all the
features of that underground nightmare were merely the dreams of one long
coma which began with the shock of my descent into that abyss and ended with
the healing balm of the outer air and of the rising sun which found me stretched
on the sands of Gizeh before the sardonic and dawn-flushed face of the Great
Sphinx.

I prefer to believe this latter explanation as much as I can, hence was glad when
the police told me that the barrier to Krephren's gateway temple had been found
unfastened, and that a sizeable rift to the surface did actually exist in one corner
of the still buried part. I was glad, too, when the doctors pronounced my wounds
only those to be expected from my seizure, blindfolding, lowering, struggling
with bonds, falling some distance - perhaps into a depression in the temple's
inner gallery - dragging myself to the outer barrier and escaping from it, and
experiences like that.., a very soothing diagnosis. And yet I know that there must
be more than appears on the surface. That extreme descent is too vivid a memory
to be dismissed - and it is odd that no one has ever been able to find a man
answering the description of my guide, Abdul Reis el Drogman- the tomb-
throated guide who looked and smiled like King Khephren.

I have digressed from my connected narrative - perhaps in the vain hope of
evading the telling of that final incident; that incident which of all is most
certainly an hallucination. But I promised to relate it, and I do not break
promises. When I recovered - or seemed to recover - my senses after that fall
down the black stone stairs, I was quite as alone and in darkness as before. The

windy stench, bad enough before, was now fiendish; yet I had acquired enough
famiharity by this time to bear it stoically. Dazedly I began to crawl away from
the place whence the putrid wind came, and with my bleeding hands felt the
colossal blocks of a mighty pavement. Once my head struck against a hard
object, and when I felt of it I learned that it was the base of a column - a column
of unbelievable immensity - whose surface was covered with gigantic chiseled
hieroglyphics very perceptible to my touch.

Crawling on, I encountered other titan columns at incomprehensible distances
apart; when suddenly my attention was captured by the realization of something
which must have been impinging on my subconscious hearing long before the
conscious sense was aware of it.

From some still lower chasm in earth's bowels were proceeding certain sounds,
measured and definite, and like nothing I had ever heard before. That they were
very ancient and distinctly ceremonial I felt almost intuitively; and much reading
in Egyptology led me to associate them with the flute, the sambuke, the sistrum,
and the tympa num. In their rhythmic piping, droning, rattling and beat ing I felt
an element of terror beyond all the known terrors of earth - a terror peculiarly
dissociated from personal fear, and taking the form of a sort of objective pity for
our planet, that it should hold within its depths such horrors as must lie beyond
these aegipanic cacophonies. The sounds increased in volume, and I felt that they
were approaching. Then - and may all the gods of all pantheons unite to keep the
like from my ears again - I began to hear, faintly and afar off, the morbid and
millennial tramping of the marching things.

It was hideous that footfalls so dissimilar should move in such perfect rhythm.
The training of unhallowed thousands of years must lie behind that march of
earth's inmost monstrosities ... padding, clicking, walking, stalking, rumbling,
lumbering, crawling.. . and all to the abhorrent discords of those mocking
instruments. And then - God keep the memory of those Arab legends out of my

head! - the mummies without souls ... the meeting-place of the wandering

the hordes of the devil-cursed pharaonic dead of forty centuries.. . the composite
mummies led through the uttermost onyx voids by King Khephren and his
ghoul-queen Nitocris . . .

The tramping drew nearer - Heaven save me from the sound of those feet and
paws and hooves and pads and talons as it commenced to acquire detail! Down
limitless reaches of sunless pavement a spark of light flickered in the malodorous
wind and I drew behind the enormous circumference of a Cyclopic column that I
might escape for a while the horror that was stalking million-footed toward me
through gigantic hypostyles of inhuman dread and phobic antiquity. The flickers
increased, and the tramping and dissonant rhythm grew sickeningly loud. In the

quivering orange light there stood faintly forth a scene of such stony awe that I
gasped from sheer wonder that conquered even fear and repulsion. Bases of
columns whose middles were higher than human sight. . . mere bases of things
that must each dwarf the Eiffel Tower to insignificance . . . hieroglyphics carved
by unthinkable hands in caverns where daylight can be only a remote legend. . .

I would not look at the marching things. That I desperately resolved as I heard
their creaking joints and nitrous wheezing above the dead music and the dead
tramping. It was merciful that they did not speak... but God! their crazy torches
began to cast shadows on the surface of those stupendous columns.
Hippopotami should not have human hands and carzy torches. . . men should not
have the heads of crocodiles. . .

I tried to turn away, but the shadows and the sounds and the stench were
everywhere. Then I remembered something I used to do in half-conscious
nightmares as a boy, and began to repeat to myself, 'This is a dream! This is a
dream!' But it was of no use, and I could only shut my eyes and pray ... at least,
that is what I think I did, for one is never sure in visions - and I know this can
have been nothing more. I wondered whether I should ever reach the world
again, and at times would furtively open my eyes to see if I could discern any
feature of the place other than the wind of spiced putrefaction, the topless
columns, and the thaumatropically grotesque shadows of abnormal horror. The
sputtering glare of multiplying torches now shone, and unless this hellish place
were wholly without walls, I could not fail to see some boundary or fixed
landmark soon. But I had to shut my eyes again when I realized how many of the
things were assembling - and when I glimpsed a certain object walking solemnly
and steadily without any body above the waist.

A fiendish and ululant corpse-gurgle or death-rattle now split the very
atmosphere - the charnel atmosphere poisonous with naftha and bitumen blasts -
in one concerted chorus from the ghoulish legion of hybrid blasphemies. My
eyes, perversely shaken open, gazed for an instant upon a sight which no human
creature could even imagine without panic, fear and physical exhaustion. The
things had filed ceremonially in one direction, the direction of the noisome wind,
where the light of their torches showed their bended heads - or the bended heads
of such as had heads. They were worshipping before a great black fetor-belching
aperture which reached up almost out of sight, -and which I could see was
flanked at right angles by two giant staircases whose ends were far away in
shadow. One of these was indubitably the staircase I had fallen down.

The dimensions of the hole were fully in proportion with those of the columns -
an ordinary house would have been lost in it, and any average public building
could easily have been moved in and out. It was so vast a surface that only by

moving the eye could one trace its boundaries.. . so vast, so hideously black, and
so aromatically stinking . .. Directly in front of this yawning Polyphemus-door
the things were throwing objects - evidently sacrifices or religious offerings, to
judge by their gestures. Khephren was their leader; sneering King Khephren or
the guide Abdul Reis, crowned with a golden pshent and intoning endless
formulae with the hollow voice of the dead. By his side knelt beautiful Queen
Nitocris, whom I saw in profile for a moment, noting that the right half of her
face was eaten away by rats or other ghouls. And I shut my eyes again when I
saw what objects were being thrown as offerings to the fetid aperture or its
possible local deity.

It occurred to me that, judging from the elaborateness of this worship, the
concealed deity must be one of considerable importance. Was it Osiris or Isis,
Horus or Anubis, or some vast unknown God of the Dead still more central and
supreme? There is a legend that terrible altars and colossi were reared to an
Unknown One before ever the known gods were worshipped. . .

And now, as I steeled myself to watch the rapt and sepulchral adorations of
those nameless things, a thought of escape flashed upon me. The hall was dim,
and the columns heavy with shadow. With every creature of that nightmare
throng absorbed in shocking raptures, it might be barely possible for me to creep
past to the far-away end of one of the staircases and ascend unseen; trusting to
Fate and skill to deliver me from the upper reaches. Where I was, I neither knew
nor seriously reflected upon - and for a

moment it struck me as amusing to plan a serious escape from that which I knew
to be a dream. Was I in some hidden and unsuspected lower realm of
Khephren' s gateway temple - that temple which generations have persis tently
called the Temple of the Sphinx? I could not conjecture, but I resolved to ascend
to life and consciousness if wit and muscle could carry me.

Wriggling flat on my stomach, I began the anxious journey toward the foot of the
left-hand staircase, which seemed the more accessible of the two. I cannot
describe the incidents and sensations of that crawl, but they may be guessed
when one reflects on what I had to watch steadily in that malign, wind-blown
torchlight in order to avoid detection. The bottom of the staircase was, as I have
said, far away in shadow, as it had to be to rise without a bend to the dizzy
parapeted landing above the titanic aperture. This placed the last stages of my
crawl at some distance from the noisome herd, though the spectacle chilled me
even when quite remote at my right.

At length I succeeded in reaching the steps and began to climb; keeping close to
the wall, on which I observed decorations of the most hideous sort, and relying

for safety on the absorbed, ecstatic interest with which the monstrosities watched
the foul-breezed aperture and the impious objects of nourishment they had flung
on the pavement before it. Though the staircase was huge and steep, fashioned of
vast porphyry blocks as if for the feet of a giant, the ascent seemed virtually
interminable. Dread of discovery and the pain which renewed exercise had
brought to my wounds combined to make that upward crawl a thing of
agonizing memory. I had intended, on reaching the landing, to climb
immediately onward along whatever upper staircase might mount from there;
stopping for no last look at the carrion abominations that pawed and genuflected
some seventy or eighty feet below - yet a sudden repetition of that thunderous
corpse-gurgle and death-rattle chorus, coming as I had nearly gained the top of
the flight and showing by its ceremonial rhythm that it was not an alarm of my
discovery, caused me to pause and peer cautiously over the parapet.

The monstrosities were hailing something which had poked itself out of the
nauseous aperture to seize the hellish fare proffered it. It was something quite
ponderous, even as seen from my height; something yellowish and hairy, and
endowed with a sort of nervous motion. It was as large, perhaps, as a good-sized
hippopotamus, but very curiously shaped. It seemed to have no neck, but five
separate shaggy heads springing in a row from a roughly cylindrical trunk; the
first very small, the second good-sized, the third and fourth equal and largest of
all, and the fifth rather small, though not so small as the first.

Out of these heads darted curious rigid tentacles which seized ravenously on the
excessively great quantities of unmentionable food placed before the aperture.
Once in a while the thing would leap up, and occasionally it would retreat into
its den in a very odd manner. Its locomotion was so inexplicable that I stared in
fascination, wishing it would emerge farther from the cavernous lair beneath me.

Then it did emerge ... it did emerge, and at the sight I turned and fled into the
darkness up the higher staircase that rose behind me; fled unknowingly up
incredible steps and ladders and inclined planes to which no human sight or
logic guided me, and which I must ever relegate to the world of dreams for want
of any confirmation. It must have been a dream, or the dawn would never have
found me breathing on the sands of Gizeh before the sardonic dawn-flushed face
of the Great Sphinx.

The Great Sphinx! God! - that idle question I asked myself on that sun-blest
morning before ... what huge and loathsome abnormality was the Sphinx
originally carven to represent?

Accursed is the sight, be it in dream or not, that revealed to me the supreme
horror - the unknown God of the Dead, which licks its colossal chops in the


unsuspected abyss, fed hideous morsels by soulless absurdities that should not
exist. The five-headed monster that emerged ... that five-headed monster as
large as a hippopotamus ... the five headed monster - and that of which it is the
merest forepaw. . .

But I survived, and I know it was only a dream.

The Call of Cthulhu



Written in 1926

Of such great powers or beings there may be conceivably a survival. . . a survival
of a hugely remote period when... consciousness was manifested, perhaps, in
shapes and forms long since withdrawn before the tide of advancing humanity. . .
forms of which poetry and legend alone have caught a flying memory and called
them gods, monsters, mythical beings of all sorts and kinds. . .

- Algernon Blackwood

I. The Horror In Clay

The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind
to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of
black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The
sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but
some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such
terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall
either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety
of a new dark age.

Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein
our world and human race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strange
survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland
optimism. But it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of forbidden
eons which chills me when I think of it and maddens me when I dream of it. That
glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out from an accidental piecing
together of separated things - in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of
a dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out;
certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain. I
think that the professor, too intented to keep silent regarding the part he knew,
and that he would have destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him.

My knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926-27 with the death of my
great-uncle, George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in
Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely
known as an authority on ancient inscriptions, and had frequently been resorted
to by the heads of prominent museums; so that his passing at the age of ninety-
two may be recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified by the obscurity
of the cause of death. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the


Newport boat; falling suddenly; as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a
nautical-looking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the
precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the
deceased's home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable to find any visible
disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the
heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was
responsible for the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum,
but latterly I am inclined to wonder - and more than wonder.

As my great-uncle's heir and executor, for he died a childless widower, I was
expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose
moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the
material which I correlated will be later published by the American
Archaeological Society, but there was one box which I found exceedingly
puzzling, and which I felt much averse from showing to other eyes. It had been
locked and I did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal
ring which the professor carried in his pocket. Then, indeed, I succeeded in
opening it, but when I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and
more closely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the queer clay bas-
relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which I found? Had my
uncle, in his latter years become credulous of the most superficial impostures? I
resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent
disturbance of an old man's peace of mind.

The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six
inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from
modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for, although the vagaries of cubism and
futurism are many and wild, they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity
which lurks in prehistoric writing. And writing of some kind the bulk of these
designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory, despite much the papers
and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this particular species,
or even hint at its remotest affiliations.

Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evident pictorial intent,
though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. It
seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form
which only a diseased fancy could conceive. If I say that my somewhat
extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon,
and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A
pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary
wings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly
frightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestions of a Cyclopean architectural
background.


The writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of press cuttings,
in Professor Angell's most recent hand; and made no pretense to Hterary style.
What seemed to be the main document was headed "CTHULHU CULT" in
characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word so
unheard-of. This manuscript was divided into two sections, the first of which
was headed "1925 - Dream and Dream Work of H.A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St.,
Providence, R. I.", and the second, "Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121
Bienville St., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg. - Notes on Same, & Prof.
Webb's Acct." The other manuscript papers were brief notes, some of them
accounts of the queer dreams of different persons, some of them citations from
theosophical books and magazines (notably W. Scott-Elliot's Atlantis and the
Lost Lemuria), and the rest comments on long-surviving secret societies and
hidden cults, with references to passages in such mythological and
anthropological source-books as Frazer's Golden Bough and Miss Murray's
Witch-Cult in Western Europe. The cuttings largely alluded to outre mental
illness and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925.

The first half of the principal manuscript told a very particular tale. It appears
that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect
had called upon Professor Angell bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was
then exceedingly damp and fresh. His card bore the name of Henry Anthony
Wilcox, and my uncle had recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent
family slightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the
Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near
that institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great
eccentricity, and had from chidhood excited attention through the strange stories
and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating. He called himself "psychically
hypersensitive", but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him
as merely "queer." Never mingling much with his kind, he had dropped
gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of
esthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its
conservatism, had found him quite hopeless.

On the ocassion of the visit, ran the professor's manuscript, the sculptor abruptly
asked for the benefit of his host's archeological knowledge in identifying the
hieroglyphics of the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which
suggested pose and alienated sympathy; and my uncle showed some sharpness
in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with
anything but archeology. Young Wilcox's rejoinder, which impressed my uncle
enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic
cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since
found highly characteristic of him. He said, "It is new, indeed, for I made it last


night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or
the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon."

It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a
sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a
slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in New
England for some years; and Wilcox's imagination had been keenly affected.
Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of
Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister
with latent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from
some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic
sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted
to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters: "Cthulhu fhtagn."

This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed
Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and
studied with frantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found
himself working, chilled and clad only in his night clothes, when waking had
stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterwards
said, for his slowness in recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design.
Many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those
which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could
not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in
exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or
paganly religious body. When Professor Angell became convinced that the
sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged
his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for
after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man,
during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imaginery whose
burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone,
with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical
sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds frequently
repeated are those rendered by the letters "Cthulhu" and "R'lyeh."

On March 23, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries at
his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and
taken to the home of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the
night, arousing several other artists in the building, and had manifested since
then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium. My uncle at once
telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close watch of the case;
calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to be in
charge. The youth's febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things;
and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them. They included not

only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on a
gigantic thing "miles high" which walked or lumbered about.

He at no time fully described this object but occasional frantic words, as repeated
by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless
monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this
object, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man's
subsidence into lethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly above
normal; but the whole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever
rather than mental disorder.

On April 2 at about 3 P.M. every trace of Wilcox's malady suddenly ceased. He
sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of
what had happened in dream or reality since the night of March 22. Pronounced
well by his physician, he returned to his quarters in three days; but to Professor
Angell he was of no further assistance. All traces of strange dreaming had
vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night-thoughts
after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions.

Here the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of the
scattered notes gave me much material for thought - so much, in fact, that only
the ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my
continued distrust of the artist. The notes in question were those descriptive of
the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young
Wilcox had had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted
a prodigiously far-flung body of inquires amongst nearly all the friends whom
he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their
dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of
his request seems to have varied; but he must, at the very least, have received
more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary.
This original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a
thorough and really significant digest. Average people in society and business -
New England's traditional "salt of the earth" - gave an almost completely
negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal
impressions appear here and there, always between March 23 and and April 2 -
the period of young Wilcox's delirium. Scientific men were little more affected,
though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange
landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormal.

It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know
that panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As it
was, lacking their original letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked
leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of


what he had latently resolved to see. That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox,
somehow cognizant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been
imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from esthetes told disturbing
tale. From February 28 to April 2 a large proportion of them had dreamed very
bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger
during the period of the sculptor's delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported
anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had
described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic
nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with
emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings
toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on the date of young
Wilcox's seizure, and expired several months later after incessant screamings to
be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle referred to these
cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some
corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing
down only a few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often
wondered if all the the objects of the professor's questioning felt as puzzled as
did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever reach them.

The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and
eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell must have employed a
cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous, and the sources
scattered throughout the globe. Here was a nocturnal suicide in London, where a
lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise a
rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic
deduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A dispatch from California
describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some
"glorious fulfiment" which never arrives, whilst items from India speak
guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March 22-23.

The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild rumour and legendry, and a fantastic
painter named Ardois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous Dream Landscape in the
Paris spring salon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane
asylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting
strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions. A weird bunch of
cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism
with which I set them aside. But I was then convinced that young Wilcox had
known of the older matters mentioned by the professor.

II. The Tale of Inspector Legrasse.

The older matters which had made the sculptor's dream and bas-relief so
significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long


manuscript. Once before, it appears. Professor Angell had seen the helHsh
outhnes of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics,
and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as "Cthulhu"; and
all this in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he pursued
young Wilcox with queries and demands for data.

This earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the
American Archaeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis. Professor
Angell, as befitted one of his authority and attainments, had had a prominent
part in all the deliberations; and was one of the first to be approached by the
several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for
correct answering and problems for expert solution.

The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire
meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had travelled all
the way from New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any
local source. His name was John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession
an Inspector of Police. With him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque,
repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a
loss to determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least
interest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was
prompted by purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or
whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps
south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so
singular and hideous were the rites connected with it, that the police could not
but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them, and
infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of
its origin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the
captured members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of
the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful
symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head.

Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering
created. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of
science into a state of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around
him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air of
genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas.
No recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries
and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of
unplaceable stone.

The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and
careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely

artistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outHne,
but with an octopus-Hke head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-
looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings
behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural
malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a
rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of
the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the centre, whilst
the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped the front
edge and extended a quarter of the way clown toward the bottom of the
pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facial
feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher's
elevated knees. The aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the more
subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and
incalculable age was unmistakable; yet not one link did it shew with any known
type of art belonging to civilisation's youth - or indeed to any other time. Totally
separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the soapy, greenish-black
stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing
familiar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along the base were equally
baffling; and no member present, despite a representation of half the world's
expert learning in this field, could form the least notion of even their remotest
linguistic kinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something
horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it. something frightfully
suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our
conceptions have no part.

And yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the
Inspector's problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch
of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently
told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew. This person was the late
William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology in Princeton University,
and an explorer of no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight
years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic
inscriptions which he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West
Greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate
Esquimaux whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its
deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which other
Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying
that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was
made. Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer
hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this
Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or
wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew how. But
just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and

around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice chffs. It
was, the professor stated, a very crude bas-rehef of stone, comprising a hideous
picture and some cryptic writing. And so far as he could tell, it was a rough
parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting.

This data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members,
proved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at once to ply his
informant with questions. Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the
swamp cult-worshippers his men had arrested, he besought the professor to
remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist
Esquimaux. There then followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a
moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the
virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of
distance apart. What, in substance, both the Esquimaux wizards and the
Louisiana swamp-priests had chanted to their kindred idols was something very
like this: the word-divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the
phrase as chanted aloud:

"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn."

Legrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among his
mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the
words meant. This text, as given, ran something like this:

"In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."

And now, in response to a general and urgent demand. Inspector Legrasse
related as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers; telling a
story to which I could see my uncle attached profound significance. It savoured
of the wildest dreams of myth-maker and theosophist, and disclosed an
astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such half-castes and pariahs as
might be least expected to possess it.

On November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a frantic
summons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there,
mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte's men, were in the grip
of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night.
It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever
known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the
malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted
woods where no dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing
screams, soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened
messenger added, the people could stand it no more.

So a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set out
in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the
passable road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the
terrible cypress woods where day never came. Ugly roots and malignant
hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank
stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a
depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to
create. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in
sight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing
lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible far, far ahead;
and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted. A
reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through pale undergrowth beyond the endless
avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the
cowed squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of
unholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on
unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before.

The region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute,
substantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were legends of a
hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless white
polypous thing with luminous eyes; and squatters whispered that bat-winged
devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight. They said
it had been there before d'Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians, and before
even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself, and
to see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep
away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this
abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps the very place of
the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and
incidents.

Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse's men
as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and muffled
tom-toms. There are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar
to beasts; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other.
Animal fury and orgiastic license here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights
by howls and squawking ecstacies that tore and reverberated through those
nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell. Now and then the
less organized ululation would cease, and from what seemed a well-drilled
chorus of hoarse voices would rise in sing-song chant that hideous phrase or
ritual:

"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn."

Then the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came
suddenly in sight of the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two
were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately
deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man, and all
stood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horror.

In a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre's extent,
clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and twisted a more
indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola
could paint. Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing, and
writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped bonfire; in the centre of which, revealed
by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great granite monolith some
eight feet in height; on top of which, incongruous in its diminutiveness, rested
the noxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular
intervals with the flame-girt monolith as a centre hung, head downward, the
oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared. It was
inside this circle that the ring of worshippers jumped and roared, the general
direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless Bacchanal
between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire.

It may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which
induced one of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal
responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the
wood of ancient legendry and horror. This man, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met
and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative. He indeed went so far
as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes and
a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees but I suppose he had been
hearing too much native superstition.

Actually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration.
Duty came first; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel
celebrants in the throng, the police relied on their firearms and plunged
determinedly into the nauseous rout. For five minutes the resultant din and
chaos were beyond description. Wild blows were struck, shots were fired, and
escapes were made; but in the end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven
sullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two
rows of policemen. Five of the worshippers lay dead, and two severely wounded
ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their fellow-prisoners. The
image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removed and carried back by
Legrasse.

Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, the
prisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentally


aberrant type. Most were seamen, and a sprinkling of Negroes and mulattoes,
largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape Verde Islands, gave a
colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult. But before many questions
were asked, it became manifest that something far deeper and older than Negro
fetishism was involved. Degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held
with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith.

They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there
were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones
were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had
told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never
died. This was that cult, and the prisoners said it had always existed and always
would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the
time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of
R'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway.
Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would
always be waiting to liberate him.

Meanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture could
not extract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of
earth, for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few. But these were not
the Great Old Ones. No man had ever seen the Old Ones. The carven idol was
great Cthulhu, but none might say whether or not the others were precisely like
him. No one could read the old writing now, but things were told by word of
mouth. The chanted ritual was not the secret - that was never spoken aloud, only
whispered. The chant meant only this: "In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu
waits dreaming."

Only two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and the rest
were committed to various institutions. All denied a part in the ritual murders,
and averred that the killing had been done by Black Winged Ones which had
come to them from their immemorial meeting-place in the haunted wood. But of
those mysterious allies no coherent account could ever be gained. What the
police did extract, came mainly from the immensely aged mestizo named Castro,
who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of
the cult in the mountains of China.

Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of
theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed.
There had been aeons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had
great cities. Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen had told him,
were still be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in the Pacific. They all died
vast epochs of time before men came, but there were arts which could revive


Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of
eternity. They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought Their
images with Them.

These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether of flesh
and blood. They had shape - for did not this star-fashioned image prove it? - but
that shape was not made of matter. When the stars were right. They could
plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong.
They could not live. But although They no longer lived. They would never really
die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the
spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious surrection when the stars and the earth
might once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside
must serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved them intact
likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They could only lie
awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by. They
knew all that was occurring in the universe, for Their mode of speech was
transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after infinities
of chaos, the first men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among
them by moulding their dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the
fleshly minds of mammals.

Then, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around tall idols which
the Great Ones shewed them; idols brought in dim eras from dark stars. That cult
would never die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take
great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth.
The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the
Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals
thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the
liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and
enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and
freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory
of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return.

In the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in dreams,
but then something happened. The great stone city R'lyeh, with its monoliths
and sepulchres, had sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the one
primal mystery through which not even thought can pass, had cut off the
spectral intercourse. But memory never died, and the high-priests said that the
city would rise again when the stars were right. Then came out of the earth the
black spirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked up
in caverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not
speak much. He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or
subtlety could elicit more in this direction. The size of the Old Ones, too, he


curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said that he thought the centre lay
amid the pathless desert of Arabia, where Irem, the City of Pillars, dreams
hidden and untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-cult, and was
virtually unknown beyond its members. No book had ever really hinted of it,
though the deathless Chinamen said that there were double meanings in the
Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read
as they chose, especially the much-discussed couplet:

That is not dead which can eternal lie.

And with strange aeons even death may die.

Legrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vain
concerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro, apparently, had told the
truth when he said that it was wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane University
could shed no light upon either cult or image, and now the detective had come to
the highest authorities in the country and met with no more than the Greenland
tale of Professor Webb.

The feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse's tale, corroborated as it
was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who
attended; although scant mention occurs in the formal publications of the society.
Caution is the first care of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and
imposture. Legrasse for some time lent the image to Professor Webb, but at the
latter's death it was returned to him and remains in his possession, where I
viewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably akin to the
dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.

That my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for what
thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had
learned of the cult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the
figure and exact hieroglyphics of the swamp-found image and the Greenland
devil tablet, but had come in his dreams upon at least three of the precise words
of the formula uttered alike by Esquimaux diabolists and mongrel Louisianans?.
Professor Angell's instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness
was eminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having
heard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams
to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle's expense. The dream-
narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of course, strong
corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole
subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions. So, after
thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and
anthropological notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to

Providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so
boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man.

Wilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas Street, a hideous
Victorian imitation of seventeenth century Breton Architecture which flaunts its
stuccoed front amidst the lovely olonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the
very shadow of the finest Georgian steeple in America, I found him at work in
his rooms, and at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his
genius is indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe, some time be heard
from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallised in clay and will one
day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which Arthur Machen
evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in verse and in painting.

Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock
and asked me my business without rising. Then I told him who I was, he
displayed some interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his
strange dreams, yet had never explained the reason for the study. I did not
enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought with some subtlety to draw him
out. In a short time I became convinced ofhis absolute sincerity, for he spoke of
the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their subconscious
residuum had influenced his art profoundly, and he shewed me a morbid statue
whose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion.
He could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dream
bas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands. It
was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really knew
nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle's relentless catechism had
let fall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which he
could possibly have received the weird impressions.

He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with
terrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone - whose
geometry, he oddly said, was all wrong - and hear with frightened expectancy
the ceaseless, half-mental calling from underground: "Cthulhu fhtagn",
"Cthulhu fhtagn."

These words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhu's
dream-vigil in his stone vault at R'lyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite my
rational beliefs. Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual way, and
had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and
imagining. Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious
expression in dreams, in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so
that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one. The youth was
of a type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered, which I could never

like, but I was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty. I
took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the success his talent promises.

The matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times I had visions of
personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions. I visited New
Orleans, talked with Legrasse and others of that old-time raiding-party, saw the
frightful image, and even questioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still
survived. Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for some years. What I now
heard so graphically at first-hand, though it was really no more than a detailed
confirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I felt sure that
I was on the track of a very real, very secret, and very ancient religion whose
discovery would make me an anthropologist of note. My attitude was still one of
absolute materialism, as 1 wish it still were, and I discounted with almost
inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings
collected by Professor Angell.

One thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my uncle's
death was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an
ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a
Negro sailor. I did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult-
members in Louisiana, and would not be surprised to learn of secret methods
and rites and beliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone; but in
Norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper inquiries
of my uncle after encountering the sculptor's data have come to sinister ears?. I
think Professor Angell died because he knew too much, or because he was likely
to learn too much. Whether I shall go as he did remains to be seen, for I have
learned much now.

III. The Madness from the Sea

If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results
of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf-paper. It
was nothing on which I would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily
round, for it was an old number of an Australian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for
April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of
its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle's research.

I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the
"Cthulhu Cult", and was visiting a learned friend in Pater son. New Jersey; the
curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the
reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the
museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread
beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend


had wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-
tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had
found in the swamp.

Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in detail;
and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested,
however, was of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully
tore it out for immediate action. It read as follows:

MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA

Vigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow. One Survivor
and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle and Deaths at Sea.
Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange Experience. Odd Idol Found in
His Possession. Inquiry to Follow.

The Morrison Co.'s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this
morning at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled
but heavily armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin, N.Z., which was sighted April
12th in S. Latitude 34°21', W. Longitude 152°17', with one living and one dead
man aboard.

The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was driven
considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster
waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted,
was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half-delirious condition
and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week. The living
man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about foot in height,
regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and
the Museum in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the
survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of
common pattern.

This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of piracy
and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had
been second mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed
for Callao February 20th with a complement of eleven men. The Emma, he says,
was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the great storm of March
1st, and on March 22nd, in S. Latitude 49°51' W. Longitude 128°34', encountered
the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes.
Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused; whereupon the
strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner
with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht's



equipment. The Emma's men shewed fight, says the survivor, and though the
schooner began to sink from shots beneath the water-hne they managed to heave
alongside their enemy and board her, grappHng with the savage crew on the
yacht's deck, and being forced to kill them all, the number being slightly
superior, because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though rather
clumsy mode of fighting.

Three of the Emma's men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate Green, were
killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to
navigate the captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any
reason for their ordering back had existed. The next day, it appears, they raised
and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the
ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly
reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock
chasm. Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to
manage her, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd, From that time till
his rescue on the 12th the man remembers little, and he does not even recall
when William Briden, his companion, died. Briden's death reveals no apparent
cause, and was probably due to excitement or exposure. Cable advices from
Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an island trader, and bore
an evil reputation along the waterfront. It was owned by a curious group of half-
castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little
curiosity; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors
of March 1st. Our Auckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an
excellent reputation, and Johansen is described as a sober and worthy man. The
admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning tomorrow, at
which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to speak more freely than he
has done hitherto.

This was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a train of
ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu
Cult, and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. What
motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the Emma as they sailed about
with their hideous idol? What was the unknown island on which six of the
Emma's crew had died, and about which the mate Johansen was so secretive?
What had the vice-admiralty's investigation brought out, and what was known
of the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvellous of all, what deep and more
than natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable
significance to the various turns of events so carefully noted by my uncle?

March 1st - or February 28th according to the International Date Line - the
earthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew
had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned, and on the other side of


the earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city
whilst a young sculptor had moulded in his sleep the form of the dreaded
Cthulhu. March 23rd the crew of the Emma landed on an unknown island and
left six men dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a
heightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster's malign
pursuit, whilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly
into delirium! And what of this storm of April 2nd - the date on which all dreams
of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed from the bondage of
strange fever? What of all this - and of those hints of old Castro about the
sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign; their faithful cult and their
mastery of dreams? Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man's
power to bear? If so, they must be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the
second of April had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its
siege of mankind's soul.

That evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host adieu
and took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin; where,
however, I found that little was known of the strange cult-members who had
lingered in the old sea-taverns. Waterfront scum was far too common for special
mentnon; though there was vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had
made, during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant
hills. In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hair turned
white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney, and had
thereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old home
in Oslo. Of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no more than he had
told the admiralty officials, and all they could do was to give me his Oslo
address.

After that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of
the vice-admiralty court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, at
Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its non-committal bulk.
The crouching image with its cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and
hieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the Museum at Hyde Park; and I
studied it long and well, finding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship,
and with the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness of
material which I had noted in Legrasse's smaller specimen. Geologists, the
curator told me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the world
held no rock like it. Then I thought with a shudder of what Old Castro had told
Legrasse about the Old Ones; "They had come from the stars, and had brought
Their images with Them."

Shaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now
resolved to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I reembarked at once

for the Norwegian capital; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in
the shadow of the Egeberg. Johansen's address, I discovered, lay in the Old
Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all
the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as "Christiana." I made the brief
trip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and
ancient building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black answered my
summons, and I was stung th disappointment when she told me in halting
English that Gustaf Johansen was no more.

He had not long survived his return, said his wife, for the doings sea in 1925 had
broken him. He had told her no more than he told the public, but had left a long
manuscript - of "technical matters" as he said - written in English, evidently in
order to guard her from the peril of casual perusal. During a walk rough a
narrow lane near the Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic
window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors at once helped him to his
feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians found
no adequate cause the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened
constitution. I now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never
leave me till I, too, am at rest; "accidentally" or otherwise. Persuad-g the widow
that my connexion with her husband's "technical matters" was sufficient to
entitle me to his manuscript, I bore the document away and began to read it on
the London boat.

It was a simple, rambling thing - a naive sailor's effort at a post-facto diary - and
strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe
it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to
shew why the sound the water against the vessel's sides became so unendurable
to me that I stopped my ears with cotton.

Johansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the city and
the Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors that
lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space, and of those unhallowed
blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea, known and favoured
by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them upon the world whenever
another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and
air.

Johansen's voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma,
in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force of
that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom
the horrors that filled men's dreams. Once more under control, the ship was
making good progress when held up by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could
feel the mate's regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the

swarthy cult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was
some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction
seem almost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of
ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of
inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under
Johansen's command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea,
and in S. Latitude 47°9', W. Longitude 123°43', come upon a coastline of mingled
mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the
tangible substance of earth's supreme terror - the nightmare corpse-city of
R'lyeh, that was built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome
shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his
hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles
incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and
called imperiously to the faithfull to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and
restoration. All this Johansen did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw
enough!

I suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned citadel
whereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I
think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill
myself forthwith. Johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this
dripping Babylon of elder daemons, and must have guessed without guidance
that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the unbelievable size of
the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith,
and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the
queer image found in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in every line
of the mates frightened description.

Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close
to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing any definite structure or
building, he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces -
surfaces too great to belong to anything right or proper for this earth, and
impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talk about angles
because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful dreams. He said
that the geometry of the dream-place he saw was abnormal, non-Euclidean, and
loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours. Now an
unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality.

Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous
Acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have
been no mortal staircase. The very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed
through the polarising miasma welling out from this sea-soaked perversion, and
twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of

carven rock where a second glance shewed concavity after the first shewed
convexity.

Something very hke fright had come over all the explorers before anything more
definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have fled had he not
feared the scorn of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that they searched -
vainly, as it proved - for some portable souvenir to bear away.

It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and
shouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at
the immense carved door with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was,
Johansen said, like a great barn-door; and they all felt that it was a door because
of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around it, though they could not decide
whether it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside cellar-door. As
Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not
be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position
of everything else seemed phantasmally variable.

Briden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Donovan felt
over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went. He
climbed interminably along the grotesque stone moulding - that is, one would
call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontal - and the men wondered
how any door in the universe could be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, the
acre-great lintel began to give inward at the top; and they saw that it was
balanced

Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and
rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the
monstrously carven portal. In this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved
anomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter and perspective
seemed upset.

The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness was
indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to
have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long
imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and
gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings. The odour rising from the newly
opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought
he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone
was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly
squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the
tainted outside air of that poison city of madness.



Poor Johansen's handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of the six
men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that
accursed instant. The Thing cannot be described - there is no language for such
abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all
matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled. God! What
wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved
with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky
spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and
what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had
done by accident. After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and
ravening for delight.

Three men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God rest
them, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan, Guerrera, and
Angstrom. Parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over
endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat, and Johansen swears he was
swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn't have been there; an angle
which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden and Johansen
reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous
monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated, floundering at the
edge of the water.

Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all
hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish
rushing up and down between wheel and engines to get the Alert under way.
Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began to
churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not
of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme
cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great
Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising
strokes of cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as
he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst
Johansen was wandering deliriously.

But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely
overtake the Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance;
and, setting the engine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the
wheel. There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as
the steam mounted higher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel
head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the
stern of a daemon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came
nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but johansen drove on relentlessly.
There was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven



sunfish, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and a sound that the chronicler
could not put on paper. For an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and
blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seething astern;
where - God in heaven! - the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn was
nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened
every second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam.

That was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and
attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his
side. He did not try to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reaction had
taken something out of his soul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and a
gathering of the clouds about his consciousness. There is a sense of spectral
whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling
universes on a comets tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon
and from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of
the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps of
Tartarus.

Out of that dream came rescue-the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty court, the streets
of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg. He
could not tell - they would think him mad. He would write of what he knew
before death came, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon if only it
could blot out the memories.

That was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside the
bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go this record of mine
- this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may
never be pieced together again. I have looked upon all that the universe has to
hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever
afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle
went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still
lives.

Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has
shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for
the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth
still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places.
He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else
the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the
end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness
waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men.
A time will come - but I must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not

survive this manuscript, my executors may put caution before audacity and see
that it meets no other eye.


The Colour Out of Space

Written in March of 1927

Published in September 1927 in Amazing Stories

West of Arkham the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep woods that
no axe has ever cut. There are dark narrow glens where the trees slope
fantastically, and where thin brooklets trickle without ever having caught the
glint of sunlight. On the gentle slopes there are farms, ancient and rocky, with
squat, moss-coated cottages brooding eternally over old New England secrets in
the lee of great ledges; but these are all vacant now, the wide chimneys
crumbling and the shingled sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs.

The old folk have gone away, and foreigners do not like to live there. French-
Canadians have tried it, Italians have tried it, and the Poles have come and
departed. It is not because of anything that can be seen or heard or handled, but
because of something that is imagined. The place is not good for imagination,
and does not bring restful dreams at night. It must be this which keeps the
foreigners away, for old Ammi Pierce has never told them of anything he recalls
from the strange days. Ammi, whose head has been a little queer for years, is the
only one who still remains, or who ever talks of the strange days; and he dares to
do this because his house is so near the open fields and the travelled roads
around Arkham.

There was once a road over the hills and through the valleys, that ran straight
where the blasted heath is now; but people ceased to use it and a new road was
laid curving far toward the south. Traces of the old one can still be found amidst
the weeds of a returning wilderness, and some of them will doubtless linger even
when half the hollows are flooded for the new reservoir. Then the dark woods
will be cut down and the blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose
surface will mirror the sky and ripple in the sun. And the secrets of the strange
days will be one with the deep's secrets; one with the hidden lore of old ocean,
and all the mystery of primal earth.

When I went into the hills and vales to survey for the new reservoir they told me
the place was evil. They told me this in Arkham, and because that is a very old
town full of witch legends I thought the evil must he something which grandams
had whispered to children through centuries. The name "blasted heath" seemed
to me very odd and theatrical, and I wondered how it had come into the folklore
of a Puritan people. Then I saw that dark westward tangle of glens and slopes for
myself, end ceased to wonder at anything beside its own elder mystery. It was



morning when I saw it, but shadow lurked always there. The trees grew too
thickly, and their trunks were too big for any healthy New England wood. There
was too much silence in the dim alleys between them, and the floor was too soft
with the dank moss and mattings of infinite years of decay.

In the open spaces, mostly along the line of the old road, there were little hillside
farms; sometimes with all the buildings standing, sometimes with only 6ne or
two, and sometimes with only a lone chimney or fast-filling cellar. Weeds and
briers reigned, and furtive wild things rustled in the undergrowth. Upon
everything was a haze of restlessness and oppression; a touch of the unreal and
the grotesque, as if some vital element of perspective or chiaroscuro were awry. I
did not wonder that the foreigners would not stay, for this was no region to sleep
in. It was too much like a landscape of Salvator Rosa; too much like some
forbidden woodcut in a tale of terror.

But even all this was not so bad as the blasted heath. I knew it the moment I
came upon it at the bottom of a spacious valley; for no other name could fit such
a thing, or any other thing fit such a name. It was as if the poet had coined the
phrase from having seen this one particular region. It must, I thought as I viewed
it, be the outcome of a fire; but why had nothing new ever grown over these five
acres of grey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a great spot eaten by
acid in the woods and fields? It lay largely to the north of the ancient road line,
but encroached a little on the other side. I felt an odd reluctance about
approaching, and did so at last only because my business took me through and
past it. There was no vegetation of any kind on that broad expanse, but only a
fine grey dust or ash which no wind seemed ever to blow about. The trees near it
were sickly and stunted, and many dead trunks stood or lay rotting at the rim.
As I walked hurriedly by I saw the tumbled bricks and stones of an old chimney
and cellar on my right, and the yawning black maw of an abandoned well whose
stagnant vapours played strange tricks with the hues of the sunlight. Even the
long, dark woodland climb beyond seemed welcome in contrast, and I marvelled
no more at the frightened whispers of Arkham people. There had been no house
or ruin near; even in the old days the place must have been lonely and remote.
And at twilight, dreading to repass that ominous spot, I walked circuitously back
to the town by the curious road on the south. I vaguely wished some clouds
would gather, for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept
into my soul.

In the evening I asked old people in Arkham about the blasted heath, and what
was meant by that phrase "strange days" which so many evasively muttered. I
could not, however, get any good answersl except that all the mystery was much
more recent than I had dreamed. It was not a matter of old legendry at all, but
something within the lifetime of those who spoke. It had happened in the



'eighties, and a family had disappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be
exact; and because they all told me to pay no attention to old Ammi Pierce's
crazy tales, I sought him out the next morning, having heard that he lived alone
in the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very thick. It was
a fearsomely ancient place, and had begun to exude the faint miasmal odour
which clings about houses that have stood too long. Only with persistent
knocking could I rouse the aged man, and when he shuffled timidly to the door
could could tell he was not glad to see me. He was not so feeble as I had
expected; but his eyes drooped in a curious way, and his unkempt clothing and
white beard made him seem very worn and dismal.

Not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales, I feigned a matter
of business; told him of my surveying, and asked vague questions about the
district. He was far brighter and more educated than I had been led to think, and
before I knew it had graNped quite as much of the subject as any man I had
talked with in Arkham. He was not like other rustics I bad known in the sections
where reservoirs were to be. From him there were no protests at the miles of old
wood and farmland to be blotted out, though perhaps there would have been
had not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake. Relief was all that he
showed; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through which he had
roamed all his life. They were better under water now - better under water since
the strange days. And with this opening his husky voice sank low, while his
body leaned forward and his right forefinger began to point shakily and
impressively.

It was then that I heard the story, and as the rambling voice scraped and
whispered on I shivered again and again spite the summer day. Often I had to
recall the speaker from ramblings, piece out scientific points which he knew only
by a fading parrot memory of professors' talk, or bridge over gaps, where his
sense of logic and continuity broke down. When he was done I did not wonder
that his mind had snapped a trifle, or that the folk of Arkham would not speak
much of the blasted heath. I hurried back before sunset to my hotel, unwilling to
have the stars come out above me in the open; and the next day returned to -
Boston to give up my position. I could not go into that dim chaos of old forest
and slope again, or face another time that grey blasted heath where the black
well yawned deep beside the tumbled bricks and stones. The reservoir will soon
be built now, and all those elder secrets will be safe forever under watery
fathoms. But even then I do not believe I would like to visit that country by night
- at least not when the sinister stars are out; and nothing could bribe me to drink
the new city water of Arkham.

It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite. Before that time there had been
no wild legends at all since the witch trials, and even then these western woods



were not feared half so much as the small island in the Miskatonic where the
devil held court beside a curious 'lone altar older than the Indians. These were
not haunted woods, and their fantastic dusk was never terrible till the strange
days. Then there had come that white noontide cloud, that string of explosions in
the air, and that pillar of smoke from the valley far in the wood. And by night all
Arkham had heard of the great rock that fell out of the sky and bedded itself in
the ground beside the well at the Nahum Gardner place. That was the house
which had stood where the blasted heath was to come - the trim white Nahum
Gardner house amidst its fertile gardens and orchards.

Nahum had come to town to tell people about the stone, and dropped in at
Ammi Pierce's on the way. Ammi was forty then, and all the queer things were
fixed very strongly in his mind. He and his wife had gone with the three
professors from Miskatonic University who hastened out the next morning to see
the weird visitor from unknown stellar space, and had wondered why Nahum
had called it so large the day before. It had shrunk, Nahum said as he pointed
out the big brownish mound above the ripped earth and charred grass near the
archaic well-sweep in his front yard; but the wise men answered that stones do
not shrink. Its heat lingered persistently, and Nahum declared it had glowed
faintly in the night. The professors tried it with a geologist's hammer and found
it was oddly soft. It was, in truth, so soft as to be almost plastic; and they gouged
rather than chipped a specimen to take back to the college for testing. They took
it in an old pail borrowed from Nahum's kitchen, for even the small piece
refused to grow cool. On the trip back they stopped at Ammi's to rest, and
seemed thoughtful when Mrs. Pierce remarked that the fragment was growing
smaller and burning the bottom of the pail. Truly, it was not large, but perhaps
they had taken less than they thought.

The day after that-all this was in June of '82-the professors had trooped out again
in a great excitement. As they passed Ammi's they told him what queer things
the specimen had done, and how it had faded wholly away when they put it in a
glass beaker. The beaker had gone, too, and the wise men talked of the strange
stone's affinity for silicon. It had acted quite unbelievably in that well-ordered
laboratory; doing nothing at all and showing no occluded gases when heated on
charcoal, being wholly negative in the borax bead, and soon proving itself
absolutely non-volatile at any producible temperature, including that of the oxy-
hydrogen blowpipe. On an anvil it appeared highly malleable, and in the dark its
luminosity was very marked. Stubbornly refusing to grow cool, it soon had the
college in a state of real excitement; and when upon heating before the
spectroscope it displayed shining bands unlike any known colours of the normal
spectrum there was much breathless talk of new elements, bizarre optical
properties, and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to say when
faced by the unknown.



Hot as it was, they tested it in a crucible with all the proper reagents. Water did
nothing. Hydrochloric acid was the same. Nitric acid and even aqua regia merely
hissed and spattered against its torrid invulnerability. Ammi had difficulty in
recalling all these things, but recognized some solvents as I mentioned them in
the usual order of use. There were am monia and caustic soda, alcohol and ether,
nauseous carbon disulphide and a dozen others; but although the weight grew
steadily less as time passed, and the fragment seemed to be slightly cooling,
there was no change in the solvents to show that they had attacked the substance
at all. It was a metal, though, beyond a doubt. It was magnetic, for one thing; and
after its immersion in the acid solvents there seemed to be faint traces of the
Widmanstatten figures found on meteoric iron. When the cooling had grown
very considerable, the testing was carried on in glass; and it was in a glass beaker
that they left all the chips made of the original fragment during the work. The
next morning both chips and beaker were gone without trace, and only a charred
spot marked the place on the wooden shelf where they had been.

All this the professors told Ammi as they paused at his door, and once more he
went with them to see the stony messenger from the stars, though this time his
wife did not accompany him. It had now most cer tainly shrunk, and even the
sober professors could not doubt the truth of what they saw. All around the
dwindling brown lump near the well was a vacant space, except where the earth
had caved in; and whereas it had been a good seven feet across the day before, it
was now scarcely five. It was still hot, and the sages studied its surface curiously
as they detached another and larger piece with hammer and chisel. They gouged
deeply this time, and as they pried away the smaller mass they saw that the core
of the thing was not quite homogeneous.

They had uncovered what seemed to be the side of a large coloured globule
embedded in the substance. The colour, which resembled some of the bands in
the meteor's strange spectrum, was almost impossible to describe; and it was
only by analogy that they called it colour at all. Its texture was glossy, and upon
tapping it appeared to promise both brittle ness and hollowness. One of the
professors gave it a smart blow with a hammer, and it burst with a nervous little
pop. Nothing was emitted, and all trace of the thing vanished with the
puncturing. It left behind a hollow spherical space about three inches across, and
all thought it probable that others would be discovered as the enclosing
substance wasted away.

Conjecture was vain; so after a futile attempt to find additional globules by
drilling, the seekers left again with their new specimen which proved, however,
as baffling in the laboratory as its predecessor. Aside from being almost plastic,
having heat, magnetism, and slight luminosity, cooling slightly in powerful
acids, possessing an unknown spec trum, wasting away in air, and attacking




silicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result, it presented no
identifying features whatsoever; and at the end of the tests the college scientists
were forced to own that they could not place it. It was nothing of this earth, but a
piece of the great outside; and as such dowered with outside properties and
obedient to outside laws.

That night there was a thunderstorm, and when the professors went out to
Nahum's the next day they met with a bitter disappointment. The stone,
magnetic as it had been, must have had some peculiar electrical property; for it
had "drawn the lightning," as Nahum said, with a singular persistence. Six times
within an hour the farmer saw the lightning strike the furrow in the front yard,
and when the storm was over nothing remained but a ragged pit by the ancient
well-sweep, half-choked with a caved-in earth. Digging had borne no fruit, and
the scientists verified the fact of the utter vanishment. The failure was total; so
that nothing was left to do but go back to the laboratory and test again the
disappearing fragment left carefully cased in lead. That fragment lasted a week,
at the end of which nothing of value had been learned of it. When it had gone, no
residue was left behind, and in time the professors felt scarcely sure they had
indeed seen with waking eyes that cryptic vestige of the fathomless gulfs
outside; that lone, weird message from other universes and other realms of
matter, force, and entity.

As was natural, the Arkham papers made much of the incident with its collegiate
sponsoring, and sent reporters to talk with Nahum Gardner and his family. At
least one Boston daily also sent a scribe, and Nahum quickly became a kind of
local celebrity. He was a lean, genial person of about fifty, living with his wife
and three sons on the pleasant farmstead in the valley. He and Ammi exchanged
visits frequently, as did their wives; and Ammi had nothing but praise for him
after all these years. He seemed slightly proud of the notice his place had
attracted, and talked often of the meteorite in the succeeding weeks. That July
and August were hot; and Nahum worked hard at his haying in the ten-acre
pasture across Chapman's Brook; his rattling wain wearing deep ruts in the
shadowy lanes between. The labour tired him more than it had in other years,
and he felt that age was beginning to tell on him.

Then fell the time of fruit and harvest. The pears and apples slowly ripened, and
Nahum vowed that his orchards were prospering as never before. The fruit was
growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss, and in such abundance that
extra barrels were ordered to handle the future crop. But with the ripening came
sore disappointment, for of all that gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not
one single jot was fit to eat. Into the fine flavour of the pears and apples had
crept a stealthy bitterness and sickishness, so that even the smallest bites induced
a lasting disgust. It was the same with the melons and tomatoes, and Nahum


sadly saw that his entire crop was lost. Quick to connect events, he declared that
the meteorite had poisoned the soil, and thanked Heaven that most of the other
crops were in the upland lot along the road.

Winter came early, and was very cold. Ammi saw Nahum less often than usual,
and observed that he had begun to look worried. The rest of his family too,
seemed to have grown taciturn; and were far from steady in their church-going
or their attendance at the various social events of the countryside. For this
reserve or melancholy no cause could be found, though all the household
confessed now and then to poorer health and a feeling of vague disquiet. Nahum
himself gave the most definite statement of anyone when he said he was
disturbed about certain footprints in the snow. They were the usual winter prints
of red squirrels, white rabbits, and foxes, but the brooding farmer professed to
see something not quite right about their nature and arrangement. He was never
specific, but appeared to think that they were not as characteristic of the anatomy
and habits of squirrels and rabbits and foxes as they ought to be. Ammi listened
without interest to this talk until one night when he drove past Nahum's house
in his sleigh on the way back from Clark's Comer. There had been a moon, and a
rabbit had run across the road, and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than
either Ammi or his horse liked. The latter, indeed, had almost run away when
brought up by a firm rein. Thereafter Ammi gave Nahum's tales more respect,
and wondered why the Gardner dogs seemed so cowed and quivering every
morning. They had, it developed, nearly lost the spirit to bark.

In February the McGregor boys from Meadow Hill were out shooting
woodchucks, and not far from the Gardner place bagged a very peculiar
specimen. The proportions of its body seemed slightly altered in a queer way
impossible to describe, while its face had taken on an expression which no one
ever saw in a woodchuck before. The boys were genuinely frightened, and threw
the thing away at once, so that only their grotesque tales of it ever reached the
people of the countryside. But the shying of horses near Nahum's house had
now become an acknowledged thing, and all the basis for a cycle of whispered
legend was fast taking form.

People vowed that the snow melted faster around Nahum's than it did anywhere
else, and early in March there was an awed discussion in Potter's general store at
Clark's Corners. Stephen Rice had driven past Gardner's in the morning, and
had noticed the skunk-cabbages coming up through the mud by the woods
across the road. Never were things of such size seen before, and they held
strange colours that could not be put into any words. Their shapes were
monstrous, and the horse had snorted at an odour which struck Stephen as
wholly unprecedented. That afternoon several persons drove past to see the
abnormal growth, and all agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in



a healthy world. The bad fruit of the fall before was freely mentioned, and it
went from mouth to mouth that there was poison in Nahum's ground. Of course
it was the meteorite; and remembering how strange the men from the college
had found that stone to be, several farmers spoke about the matter to them.

One day they paid Nahum a visit; but having no love of wild tales and folklore
were very conservative in what they inferred. The plants were certainly odd, but
all skunk-cabbages are more or less odd in shape and hue. Perhaps some mineral
element from the stone had entered the soil, but it would soon be washed away.
And as for the footprints and frightened horses - of course this was mere country
talk which such a phenomenon as the aerolite would be certain to start. There
was really nothing for serious men to do in cases of wild gossip, for superstitious
rustics will say and believe anything. And so all through the strange days the
professors stayed away in contempt. Only one of them, when given two phials of
dust for analysis in a police job over a year and half later, recalled that the queer
colour of that skunk-cabbage had been very like one of the anomalous bands of
light shown by the meteor fragment in the college spectroscope, and like the
brittle globule found imbedded in the stone from the abyss. The samples in this
analysis case gave the same odd bands at first, though later they lost the
property.

The trees budded prematurely around Nahum's, and at night they swayed
ominously in the wind. Nahum's second son Thaddeus, a lad of fifteen, swore
that they swayed also when there was no wind; but even the gossips would not
credit this. Certainly, however, restlessness was in the air. The entire Gardner
family developed the habit of stealthy listening, though not for any sound which
they could consciously name. The listening was, indeed, rather a product of
moments when consciousness seemed half to slip away. Unfortunately such
moments increased week by week, till it became common speech that
"something was wrong with all Nahum's folks." When the early saxifrage came
out it had another strange colour; not quite like that of the skunk-cabbage, but
plainly related and equally unknown to anyone who saw it. Nahum took some
blossoms to Arkham and showed them to the editor of the Gazette, but that
dignitary did no more than write a humorous article about them, in which the
dark fears of rustics were held up to polite ridicule. It was a mistake of Nahum's
to tell a stolid city man about the way the great, overgrown mourning-cloak
butterflies behaved in connection with these saxifrages.

April brought a kind of madness to the country folk, and began that disuse of the
road past Nahum's which led to its ultimate abandonment. It was the vegetation.
All the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours, and through the stony
soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which
only a botanist could connect with the proper flora of the region. No sane



wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and
leafage; but everywhere were those hectic and prismatic variants of some
diseased, underlying primary tone without a place among the' known tints of
earth. The "Dutchman's breeches" became a thing of sinister menace, and the
bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion. Ammi and the Gardners
thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting familiarity, and decided
that they reminded one of the brittle globule in the meteor. Nahum ploughed
and sowed the ten-acre pasture and the upland lot, but did nothing with the land
around the house. He knew it would be of no use, and hoped that the summer's
strange growths would draw all the poison from the soil. He was prepared for
almost anything now, and had grown used to the sense of something near him
waiting to be heard. The shunning of his house by neighbors told on him, of
course; but it told on his wife more. The boys were better off, being at school
each day; but they could not help being frightened by the gossip. Thaddeus, an
especially sensitive youth, suffered the most.

In May the insects came, and Nahum's place became a nightmare of buzzing and
crawling. Most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in their aspects and
motions, and their nocturnal habits contradicted all former experience. The
Gardners took to watching at night - watching in all directions at random for
something - they could not tell what. It was then that they owned that Thaddeus
had been right about the trees. Mrs. Gardner was the next to see it from the
window as she watched the swollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky.
The boughs surely moved, and there was no 'wind. It must be the sap.
Strangeness had come into everything growing now. Yet it was none of Nahum's
family at all who made the next discovery. Familiarity had dulled them, and
what they could not see was glimpsed by a timid windmill salesman from Bolton
who drove by one night in ignorance of the country legends. What he told in
Arkham was given a short paragraph in the Gazette; and it was there that all the
farmers, Nahum included, saw it first. The night had been dark and the buggy-
lamps faint, but around a farm in the valley which everyone knew from the
account must be Nahum's, the darkness had been less thick. A dim though
distinct luminosity seemed to inhere in all the vegetation, grass, leaves, and
blossoms alike, while at one moment a detached piece of the phosphorescence
appeared to stir furtively in the yard near the barn.

The grass had so far seemed untouched, and the cows were freely pastured in the
lot near the house, but toward the end of May the milk began to be bad. Then
Nahum had the cows driven to the uplands, after which this trouble ceased. Not
long after this the change in grass and leaves became apparent to the eye. All the
verdure was going grey, and was developing a highly singular quality of
brittleness. Ammi was now the only person who ever visited the place, and his
visits were becoming fewer and fewer. When school closed the Gardners were



virtually cut off from the world, and sometimes let Ammi do their errands in
town. They were failing curiously both physically and mentally, and no one was
surprised when the news of Mrs. Gardner's madness stole around.

It happened in June, about the anniversary of the meteor's fall, and the poor
woman screamed about things in the air which she could not describe. In her
raving there was not a single specific noun, but only verbs and pronouns. Things
moved and changed and fluttered, and ears tingled to impulses which were not
wholly sounds. Something was taken away - she was being drained of something
- something was fastening itself on her that ought not to be - someone must make
it keep off - nothing was ever still in the night - the walls and windows shifted.
Nahum did not send her to the county asylum, but let her wander about the
house as long as she was harmless to herself and others. Even when her
expression changed he did nothing. But when the boys grew afraid of her, and
Thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she made faces at him, he decided to keep
her locked in the attic. By July she had ceased to speak and crawled on all fours,
and before that month was over Nahum got the mad notion that she was slightly
luminous in the dark, as he now clearly saw was the case with the nearby
vegetation.

It was a little before this that the horses had stampeded. Something had aroused
them in the night, and their neighing and kicking in their stalls had been terrible.
There seemed virtually nothing to do to calm them, and when Nahum opened
the stable door they all bolted out like frightened woodland deer. It took a week
to track all four, and when found they were seen to be quite useless and
unmanageable. Something had snapped in their brains, and each one had to be
shot for its own good. Nahum borrowed a horse from Ammi for his haying, but
found it would not approach the barn. It shied, balked, and whinnied, and in the
end he could do nothing but drive it into the yard while the men used their own
strength to get the heavy wagon near enough the hayloft for convenient pitching.
And all the while the vegetation was turning grey and brittle. Even the flowers
whose hues had been so strange were greying now, and the fruit was coming out
grey and dwarfed and tasteless. The asters and golden-rod bloomed grey and
distorted, and the roses and zinneas and hollyhocks in the front yard were such
blasphemous-looking things that Nahum's oldest boy Zenas cut them down. The
strangely puffed insects died about that time, even the bees that had left their
hives and taken to the woods.

By September all the vegetation was fast crumbling to a greyish powder, and
Nahum feared that the trees would die before the poison was out of the soil. His
wife now had spells of terrific screaming, and he and the boys were in a constant
state of nervous tension. They shunned people now, and when school opened the
boys did not go. But it was Ammi, on one of his rare visits, who first realised that


the well water was no longer good. It had an evil taste that was not exactly fetid
nor exactly salty, and Ammi advised his friend to dig another well on higher
ground to use till the soil was good again. Nahum, however, ignored the
warning, for he had by that time become calloused to strange and unpleasant
things. He and the boys continued to use the tainted supply, drinking it as
listlessly and mechanically as they ate their meagre and ill-cooked meals and did
their thankless and monotonous chores through the aimless days. There was
something of stolid resignation about them all, as if they walked half in another
world between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doom.

Thaddeus went mad in September after a visit to the well. He had gone with a
pail and had come back empty-handed, shrieking and waving his arms, and
sometimes lapsing into an inane titter or a whisper about "the moving colours
down there." Two in one family was pretty bad, but Nahum was very brave
about it. He let the boy run about for a week until he began stumbling and
hurting himself, and then he shut him in an attic room across the hall from his
mother's. The way they screamed at each other from behind their locked doors
was very terrible, especially to little Merwin, who fancied they talked in some
terrible language that was not of earth. Merwin was getting frightfully
imaginative, and his restlessness was worse after the shutting away of the
brother who had been his greatest playmate.

Almost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced. Poultry
turned greyish and died very quickly, their meat being found dry and noisome
upon cutting. Hogs grew inordinately fat, then suddenly began to undergo
loathsome changes which no one could explain. Their meat was of course
useless, and Nahum was at his wit's end. No rural veterinary would approach
his place, and the city veterinary from Arkham was openly baffled. The swine
began growing grey and brittle and falling to pieces before they died, and their
eyes and muzzles developed singular alterations. It was very inexplicable, for
they had never been fed from the tainted vegetation. Then something struck the
cows. Certain areas or sometimes the whole body would be uncannily shrivelled
or compressed, and atrocious collapses or disintegrations were common. In the
last stages - and death was always the result - there would be a greying and
turning brittle like that which beset the hogs. There could be no question of
poison, for all the cases occurred in a locked and undisturbed barn. No bites of
prowling things could have brought the virus, for what live beast of earth can
pass through solid obstacles? It must be only natural disease - yet what disease
could wreak such results was beyond any mind's guessing. When the harvest
came there was not an animal surviving on the place, for the stock and poultry
were dead and the dogs had run away. These dogs, three in number, had all
vanished one night and were never heard of again. The five cats had left some



time before, but their going was scarcely noticed since there now seemed to be no
mice, and only Mrs. Gardner had made pets of the graceful felines.

On the nineteenth of October Nahum staggered into Ammi's house with hideous
news. The death had come to poor Thaddeus in his attic room, and it had come
in a way which could not be told. Nahum had dug a grave in the railed family
plot behind the farm, and had put therein what he found. There could have been
nothing from outside, for the small barred window and locked door were intact;
but it was much as it had been in the barn. Ammi and his wife consoled the
stricken man as best they could, but shuddered as they did so. Stark terror
seemed to cling round the Gardners and all they touched, and the very presence
of one in the house was a breath from regions unnamed and unnamable. Ammi
accompanied Nahum home with the greatest reluctance, and did what he might
to calm the hysterical sobbing of little Merwin. Zenas needed no calming. He had
come of late to do nothing but stare into space and obey what his father told him;
and Ammi thought that his fate was very merciful. Now and then Merwin's
screams were answered faintly from the attic, and in response to an inquiring
look Nahum said that his wife was getting very feeble. When night approached,
Ammi managed to get away; for not even friendship could make him stay in that
spot when the faint glow of the vegetation began and the trees may or may not
have swayed without wind. It was really lucky for Ammi that he was not more
imaginative. Even as things were, his mind was bent ever so slightly; but had he
been able to connect and reflect upon all the portents around him he must
inevitably have turned a total maniac. In the twilight he hastened home, the
screams of the mad woman and the nervous child ringing horribly in his ears.

Three days later Nahum burst into Ammi's kitchen in the early morning, and in
the absence of his host stammered out a desperate tale once more, while Mrs.
Pierce listened in a clutching fright. It was little Merwin this time. He was gone.
He had gone out late at night with a lantern and pail for water, and had never
come back. He'd been going to pieces for days, and hardly knew what he was
about. Screamed at everything. There had been a frantic shriek from the yard
then, but before the father could get to the door the boy was gone. There was no
glow from the lantern he had taken, and of the child himself no trace. At the time
Nahum thought the lantern and pail were gone too; but when dawn came, and
the man had plodded back from his all-night search of the woods and fields, he
had found some very curious things near the well. There was a crushed and
apparently somewhat melted mass of iron which had certainly been the lantern;
while a bent handle and twisted iron hoops beside it, both half-fused, seemed to
hint at the remnants of the pail. That was all. Nahum was past imagining, Mrs.
Pierce was blank, and Ammi, when he had reached home and heard the tale,
could give no guess. Merwin was gone, and there would be no use in telling the
people around, who shunned all Gardners now. No use, either, in telling the city


people at Arkham who laughed at everything. Thad was gone, and now Merwin
was gone. Something was creeping and creeping and waiting to be seen and
heard. Nahum would go soon, and he wanted Ammi to look after his wife and
Zenas if they survived him. It must all be a judgment of some sort; though he
could not fancy what for, since he had always walked uprightly in the Lord's
ways so far as he knew.

For over two weeks Ammi saw nothing of Nahum; and then, worried about
what might have happened, he overcame his fears and paid the Gardner place a
visit. There was no smoke from the great chimney, and for a moment the visitor
was apprehensive of the worst. The aspect of the whole farm was shocking -
greyish withered grass and leaves on the ground, vines falling in brittle
wreckage from archaic walls and gables, and great bare trees clawing up at the
grey November sky with a studied malevolence which Ammi could not but feel
had come from some subtle change in the tilt of the branches. But Nahum was
alive, after all. He was weak, and lying on a couch in the low-ceiled kitchen, but
perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to Zenas. The room was
deadly cold; and as Ammi visibly shivered, the host shouted huskily to Zenas for
more wood. Wood, indeed, was sorely needed; since the cavernous fireplace was
unlit and empty, with a cloud of soot blowing about in the chill wind that came
down the chimney. Presently Nahum asked him if the extra wood had made him
any more comfortable, and then Ammi saw what had happened. The stoutest
cord had broken at last, and the hapless farmer's mind was proof against more
sorrow.

Questioning tactfully, Ammi could get no clear data at all about the missing
Zenas. "In the well - he lives in the well - " was all that the clouded father would
say. Then there flashed across the visitor's mind a sudden thought of the mad
wife, and he changed his line of inquiry. "Nabby? Why, here she is!" was the
surprised response of poor Nahum, and Ammi soon saw that he must search for
himself. Leaving the harmless babbler on the couch, he took the keys from their
nail beside the door and climbed the creaking stairs to the attic. It was very close
and noisome up there, and no sound could be heard from any direction. Of the
four doors in sight, only one was locked, and on this he tried various keys of the
ring he had taken. The third key proved the right one, and after some fumbling
Ammi threw open the low white door.

It was quite dark inside, for the window was small and half-obscured by the
crude wooden bars; and Ammi could see nothing at all on the wide-planked
floor. The stench was beyond enduring, and before proceeding further he had to
retreat to another room and return with his lungs filled with breathable air.
When he did enter he saw something dark in the corner, and upon seeing it more
clearly he screamed outright. While he screamed he thought a momentary cloud


eclipsed the window, and a second later he felt himself brushed as if by some
hateful current of vapour. Strange colours danced before his eyes; and had not a
present horror numbed him he would have thought of the globule in the meteor
that the geologist's hammer had shattered, and of the morbid vegetation that had
sprouted in the spring. As it was he thought only of the blasphemous
monstrosity which confronted him, and which all too clearly had shared the
nameless fate of young Thaddeus and the livestock. But the terrible thing about
the horror was that it very slowly and perceptibly moved as it continued to
crumble.

Ammi would give me no added particulars of this scene, but the shape in the
comer does not reappear in his tale as a moving object. There are things which
cannot be mentioned, and what is done in common humanity is sometimes
cruelly judged by the law. I gathered that no moving thing was left in that attic
room, and that to leave anything capable of motion there would have been a
deed so monstrous as to damn any accountable being to eternal torment. Anyone
but a stolid farmer would have fainted or gone mad, but Ammi walked
conscious through that low doorway and locked the accursed secret behind him.
There would be Nahum to deal with now; he must be fed and tended, and
removed to some place where he could be cared for.

Commencing his descent of the dark stairs. Ammi heard a thud below him. He
even thought a scream had been suddenly choked off, and recalled nervously the
clammy vapour which had brushed by him in that frightful room above. What
presence had his cry and entry started up? Halted by some vague fear, he heard
still further sounds below. Indubitably there was a sort of heavy dragging, and a
most detestably sticky noise as of some fiendish and unclean species of suction.
With an associative sense goaded to feverish heights, he thought unaccountably
of what he had seen upstairs. Good God! What eldritch dream-world was this
into which he had blundered? He dared move neither backward nor forward,
but stood there trembling at the black curve of the boxed-in staircase. Every trifle
of the scene burned itself into his brain. The sounds, the sense of dread
expectancy, the darkness, the steepness of the narrow step - and merciful
Heaven! - the faint but unmistakable luminosity of all the woodwork in sight;
steps, sides, exposed laths, and beams alike.

Then there burst forth a frantic whinny from Ammi's horse outside, followed at
once by a clatter which told of a frenzied runaway. In another moment horse and
buggy had gone beyond earshot, leaving the frightened man on the dark stairs to
guess what had sent them. But that was not all. There had been another sound
out there. A sort of liquid splash - water - it must have been the well. He had left
Hero untied near it, and a buggy wheel must have brushed the coping and
knocked in a stone. And still the pale phosphorescence glowed in that detestably


ancient woodwork. God! how old the house was! Most of it buih before 1670,
and the gambrel roof no later than 1730.

A feeble scratching on the floor downstairs now sounded distinctly, and Ammi's
grip tightened on a heavy stick he had picked up in the attic for some purpose.
Slowly nerving himself, he finished his descent and walked boldly toward the
kitchen. But he did not complete the walk, because what he sought was no
longer there. It had come to meet him, and it was still alive after a fashion.
Whether it had crawled or whether it had been dragged by any external forces,
Ammi could not say; but the death had been at it. Everything had happened in
the last half-hour, but collapse, greying, and disintegration were already far
advanced. There was a horrible brittleness, and dry fragments were scaling off.
Ammi could not touch it, but looked horrifiedly into the distorted parody that
had been a face. "What was it, Nahum - what was it?" He whispered, and the
cleft, bulging lips were just able to crackle out a final answer.

"Nothin'... nothin'... the colour... it burns... cold an' wet, but it burns... it lived
in the well... I seen it... a kind of smoke... jest like the flowers last spring... the
well shone at night... Thad an' Merwin an' Zenas... everything alive... suckin'
the life out of everything... in that stone... it must a' come in that stone pizened
the whole place... dun't know what it wants... that round thing them men from
the college dug outen the stone. . . they smashed it. . . it was the same colour. . . jest
the same, like the flowers an' plants... must a' ben more of 'em... seeds...
seeds... they growed... I seen it the fust time this week... must a' got strong on
Zenas... he was a big boy, full o' life... it beats down your mind an' then gets
ye... burns ye up... in the well water... you was right about that... evil water...
Zenas never come back from the well... can't git away... draws ye... ye know
summ'at's comin' but tain't no use... I seen it time an' agin senct Zenas was
took... whar's Nabby, Ammi?... my head's no good... dun't know how long
sense I fed her. . . it'll git her ef we ain't keerful. . . jest a colour. . . her face is gittin'
to hev that colour sometimes towards night... an' it burns an' sucks... it come
from some place whar things ain't as they is here... one o' them professors said
so. . . he was right. . . look out, Ammi, it'll do suthin' more. . . sucks the life out. . ."

But that was all. That which spoke could speak no more because it had
completely caved in. Ammi laid a red checked tablecloth over what was left and
reeled out the back door into the fields. He climbed the slope to the ten-acre
pasture and stumbled home by the north road and the woods. He could not pass
that well from which his horses had run away. He had looked at it through the
window, and had seen that no stone was missing from the rim. Then the lurching
buggy had not dislodged anything after all - the splash had been something else -
something which went into the well after it had done with poor Nahum.



When Ammi reached his house the horses and buggy had arrived before him
and thrown his wife into fits of anxiety. Reassuring her without explanations, he
set out at once for Arkham and notified the authorities that the Gardner family
was no more. He indulged in no details, but merely told of the deaths of Nahum
and Nabby, that of Thaddeus being already known, and mentioned that the
cause seemed to be the same strange ailment which had killed the live-stock. He
also stated that Merwin and Zenas had disappeared. There was considerable
questioning at the police station, and in the end Ammi was compelled to take
three officers to the Gardner farm, together with the coroner, the medical
examiner, and the veterinary who had treated the diseased animals. He went
much against his will, for the afternoon was advancing and he feared the fall of
night over that accursed place, but it was some comfort to have so many people
with him.

The six men drove out in a democrat-wagon, following Ammi's buggy, and
arrived at the pest-ridden farmhouse about four o'clock. Used as the officers
were to gruesome experiences, not one remained unmoved at what was found in
the attic and under the red checked tablecloth on the floor below. The whole
aspect of the farm with its grey desolation was terrible enough, but those two
crumbling objects were beyond all bounds. No one could look long at them, and
even the medical examiner admitted that there was very little to examine.
Specimens could be analysed, of course, so he busied himself in obtaining them -
and here it develops that a very puzzling aftermath occurred at the college
laboratory where the two phials of dust were finally taken. Under the
spectroscope both samples gave off an unknown spectrum, in which many of the
baffling bands were precisely like those which the strange meteor had yielded in
the previous year. The property of emitting this spectrum vanished in a month,
the dust thereafter consisting mainly of alkaline phosphates and carbonates.

Ammi would not have told the men about the well if he had thought they meant
to do anything then and there. It was getting toward sunset, and he was anxious
to be away. But he could not help glancing nervously at the stony curb by the
great sweep, and when a detective questioned him he admitted that Nahum had
feared something down there so much so that he had never even thought of
searching it for Merwin or Zenas. After that nothing would do but that they
empty and explore the well immediately, so Ammi had to wait trembling while
pail after pail of rank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground
outside. The men sniffed in disgust at the fluid, and toward the last held their
noses against the foetor they were uncovering. It was not so long a job as they
had feared it would be, since the water was phenomenally low. There is no need
to speak too exactly of what they found. Merwin and Zenas were both there, in
part, though the vestiges were mainly skeletal. There were also a small deer and
a large dog in about the same state, and a number of bones of small animals. The


ooze and slime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling, and a
man who descended on hand-holds with a long pole found that he could sink the
wooden shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting any solid
obstruction.

Twilight had now fallen, and lanterns were brought from the house. Then, when
it was seen that nothing further could be gained from the well, everyone went
indoors and conferred in the ancient sitting-room while the intermittent light of a
spectral half-moon played wanly on the grey desolation outside. The men were
frankly nonplussed by the entire case, and could find no convincing common
element to link the strange vegetable conditions, the unknown disease of live-
stock and humans, and the unaccountable deaths of Merwin and Zenas in the
tainted well. They had heard the common country talk, it is true; but could not
believe that anything contrary to natural law had occurred. No doubt the meteor
had poisoned the soil, but the illness of persons and animals who had eaten
nothing grown in that soil was another matter. Was it the well water? Very
possibly. It might be a good idea to analyze it. But what peculiar madness could
have made both boys jump into the well? Their deeds were so similar-and the
fragments showed that they had both suffered from the grey brittle death. Why
was everything so grey and brittle?

It was the coroner, seated near a window overlooking the yard, who first noticed
the glow about the well. Night had fully set in, and all the abhorrent grounds
seemed faintly luminous with more than the fitful moonbeams; but this new
glow was something definite and distinct, and appeared to shoot up from the
black pit like a softened ray from a searchlight, giving dull reflections in the little
ground pools where the water had been emptied. It had a very queer colour, and
as all the men clustered round the window Ammi gave a violent start. For this
strange beam of ghastly miasma was to him of no unfamiliar hue. He had seen
that colour before, and feared to think what it might mean. He had seen it in the
nasty brittle globule in that aerolite two summers ago, had seen it in the crazy
vegetation of the springtime, and had thought he had seen it for an instant that
very morning against the small barred window of that terrible attic room where
nameless things had happened. It had flashed there a second, and a clammy and
hateful current of vapour had brushed past him - and then poor Nahum had
been taken by something of that colour. He had said so at the last - said it was
like the globule and the plants. After that had come the runaway in the yard and
the splash in the well-and now that well was belching forth to the night a pale
insidious beam of the same demoniac tint.

It does credit to the alertness of Ammi's mind that he puzzled even at that tense
moment over a point which was essentially scientific. He could not but wonder
at his gleaning of the same impression from a vapour glimpsed in the daytime.



against a window opening on the morning sky, and from a nocturnal exhalation
seen as a phosphorescent mist against the black and blasted landscape. It wasn't
right - it was against Nature - and he thought of those terrible last words of his
stricken friend, "It come from some place whar things ain't as they is here... one
o' them professors said so..."

All three horses outside, tied to a pair of shrivelled saplings by the road, were
now neighing and pawing frantically. The wagon driver started for the door to
do something, but Ammi laid a shaky hand on his shoulder. "Dun't go out thar,"
he whispered. "They's more to this nor what we know. Nahum said somethin'
lived in the well that sucks your life out. He said it must be some'at growed from
a round ball like one we all seen in the meteor stone that fell a year ago June.
Sucks an' burns, he said, an' is jest a cloud of colour like that light out thar now,
that ye can hardly see an' can't tell what it is. Nahum thought it feeds on
everything livin' an' gits stronger all the time. He said he seen it this last week. It
must be somethin' from away off in the sky like the men from the college last
year says the meteor stone was. The way it's made an' the way it works ain't like
no way 0' God's world. It's some'at from beyond."

So the men paused indecisively as the light from the well grew stronger and the
hitched horses pawed and whinnied in increasing frenzy. It was truly an awful
moment; with terror in that ancient and accursed house itself, four monstrous
sets of fragments-two from the house and two from the well-in the woodshed
behind, and that shaft of unknown and unholy iridescence from the slimy depths
in front. Ammi had restrained the driver on impulse, forgetting how uninjured
he himself was after the clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in the attic
room, but perhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did. No one will ever know
what was abroad that night; and though the blasphemy from beyond had not so
far hurt any human of unweakened mind, there is no telling what it might not
have done at that last moment, and with its seemingly increased strength and the
special signs of purpose it was soon to display beneath the half-clouded moonlit
sky.

All at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short, sharp gasp. The
others looked at him, and then quickly followed his own gaze upward to the
point at which its idle straying had been suddenly arrested. There was no need
for words. What had been disputed in country gossip was disputable no longer,
and it is because of the thing which every man of that party agreed in whispering
later on, that the strange days are never talked about in Arkham. It is necessary
to premise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening. One did arise not
long afterward, but there was absolutely none then. Even the dry tips of the
lingering hedge-mustard, grey and blighted, and the fringe on the roof of the
standing democrat-wagon were unstirred. And yet amid that tense godless calm


the high bare boughs of all the trees in the yard were moving. They were
twitching morbidly and spasmodically, clawing in convulsive and epileptic
madness at the moonlit clouds; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if
jerked by some allied and bodiless line of linkage with subterrene horrors
writhing and struggling below the black roots.

Not a man breathed for several seconds. Then a cloud of darker depth passed
over the moon, and the silhouette of clutching branches faded out momentarily.
At this there was a general cry; muffled with awe, but husky and almost identical
from every throat. For the terror had not faded with the silhouette, and in a
fearsome instant of deeper darkness the watchers saw wriggling at that tree top
height a thousand tiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance, tipping each
bough like the fire of St. Elmo or the flames that come down on the apostles'
heads at Pentecost. It was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light, like a
glutted swarm of corpse-fed fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an accursed
marsh, and its colour was that same nameless intrusion which Ammi had come
to recognize and dread. All the while the shaft of phosphorescence from the well
was getting brighter and brighter, bringing to the minds of the huddled men, a
sense of doom and abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious
minds could form. It was no longer shining out; it was pouring out; and as the
shapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow directly
into the sky.

The veterinary shivered, and walked to the front door to drop the heavy extra
bar across it. Ammi shook no less, and had to tug and point for lack of
controllable voice when he wished to draw notice to the growing luminosity of
the trees. The neighing and stamping of the horses had become utterly frightful,
but not a soul of that group in the old house would have ventured forth for any
earthly reward. With the moments the shining of the trees increased, while their
restless branches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality. The wood
of the well-sweep was shining now, and presently a policeman dumbly pointed
to some wooden sheds and bee-hives near the stone wall on the west. They were
commencing to shine, too, though the tethered vehicles of the visitors seemed so
far unaffected. Then there was a wild commotion and clopping in the road, and
as Ammi quenched the lamp for better seeing they realized that the span of
frantic greys had broken their sapling and run off with the democrat-wagon.

The shock served to loosen several tongues, and embarrassed whispers were
exchanged. "It spreads on everything organic that's been around here," muttered
the medical examiner. No one replied, but the man who had been in the well
gave a hint that his long pole must have stirred up something intangible. "It was
awful," he added. "There was no bottom at all. Just ooze and bubbles and the
feeling of something lurking under there." Ammi's horse still pawed and


screamed deafeningly in the road outside, and nearly drowned its owner's faint
quaver as he mumbled his formless reflections. "It come from that stone - it
growed down thar - it got everything livin' - it fed itself on 'em, mind and body -
Thad an' Merwin, Zenas an' Nabby - Nahum was the last - they all drunk the
water - it got strong on 'em - it come from beyond, whar things ain't like they be
here - now it's goin' home -"

At this point, as the column of unknown colour flared suddenly stronger and
began to weave itself into fantastic suggestions of shape which each spectator
described differently, there came from poor tethered Hero such a sound as no
man before or since ever heard from a horse. Every person in that low-pitched
sitting room stopped his ears, and Ammi turned away from the window in
horror and nausea. Words could not convey it - when Ammi looked out again
the hapless beast lay huddled inert on the moonlit ground between the
splintered shafts of the buggy. That was the last of Hero till they buried him next
day. But the present was no time to mourn, for almost at this instant a detective
silently called attention to something terrible in the very room with them. In the
absence of the lamplight it was clear that a faint phosphorescence had begun to
pervade the entire apartment. It glowed on the broad-planked floor and the
fragment of rag carpet, and shimmered over the sashes of the small-paned
windows. It ran up and down the exposed corner-posts, coruscated about the
shelf and mantel, and infected the very doors and furniture. Each minute saw it
strengthen, and at last it was very plain that healthy living things must leave that
house.

Ammi showed them the back door and the path up through the fields to the ten-
acre pasture. They walked and stumbled as in a dream, and did not dare look
back till they were far away on the high ground. They were glad of the path, for
they could not have gone the front way, by that well. It was bad enough passing
the glowing barn and sheds, and those shining orchard trees with their gnarled,
fiendish contours; but thank Heaven the branches did their worst twisting high
up. The moon went under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic
bridge over Chapman's Brook, and it was blind groping from there to the open
meadows.

When they looked back toward the valley and the distant Gardner place at the
bottom they saw a fearsome sight. At the farm was shining with the hideous
unknown blend of colour; trees, buildings, and even such grass and herbage as
had not been wholly changed to lethal grey brittleness. The boughs were all
straining skyward, tipped with tongues of foul flame, and lambent tricklings of
the same monstrous fire were creeping about the ridgepoles of the house, barn
and sheds. It was a scene from a vision of Fuseli, and over all the rest reigned
that riot of luminous amorphousness, that alien and undimensioned rainbow of



cryptic poison from the well - seething, feeling, lapping, reaching, scintillating,
straining, and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and unrecognizable chromaticism.

Then without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the sky like a
rocket or meteor, leaving behind no trail and disappearing through a round and
curiously regular hole in the clouds before any man could gasp or cry out. No
watcher can ever forget that sight, and Ammi stared blankly at the stars of
Cygnus, Deneb twinkling above the others, where the unknown colour had
melted into the Milky Way. But his gaze was the next moment called swiftly to
earth by the crackling in the valley. It was just that. Only a wooden ripping and
crackling, and not an explosion, as so many others of the party vowed. Yet the
outcome was the same, for in one feverish kaleidoscopic instant there burst up
from that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of
unnatural sparks and substance; blurring the glance of the few who saw it, and
sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of such coloured and
fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown. Through quickly
reclosing vapours they followed the great morbidity that had vanished, and in
another second they had vanished too. Behind and below was only a darkness to
which the men dared not return, and all about was a mounting wind which
seemed to sweep down in black, frore gusts from interstellar space. It shrieked
and howled, and lashed the fields and distorted woods in a mad cosmic frenzy,
till soon the trembling party realized it would be no use waiting for the moon to
show what was left down there at Nahum's.

Too awed even to hint theories, the seven shaking men trudged back toward
Arkham by the north road. Ammi was worse than his fellows, and begged them
to see him inside his own kitchen, instead of keeping straight on to town. He did
not wish to cross the blighted, wind-whipped woods alone to his home on the
main road. For he had had an added shock that the others were spared, and was
crushed forever with a brooding fear he dared not even mention for many years
to come. As the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set
their faces toward the road, Ammi had looked back an instant at the shadowed
valley of desolation so lately sheltering his ill-starred friend. And from that
stricken, far-away spot he had seen something feebly rise, only to sink down
again upon the place from which the great shapeless horror had shot into the
sky. It was just a colour - but not any colour of our earth or heavens. And
because Ammi recognized that colour, and knew that this last faint remnant
must still lurk down there in the well, he has never been quite right since.

Ammi would never go near the place again. It is forty-four years now since the
horror happened, but he has never been there, and will be glad when the new
reservoir blots it out. I shall be glad, too, for I do not like the way the sunlight
changed colour around the mouth of that abandoned well I passed. I hope the



water will always be very deep - but even so, I shall never drink it. I do not think
I shall visit the Arkham country hereafter. Three of the men who had been with
Ammi returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight, but there were not
any real ruins. Only the bricks of the chimney, the stones of the cellar, some
mineral and metallic litter here and there, and the rim of that nefandous well.
Save for Ammi's dead horse, which they towed away and buried, and the buggy
which they shortly returned to him, everything that had ever been living had
gone. Five eldritch acres of dusty grey desert remained, nor has anything ever
grown there since. To this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten
by acid in the woods and fields, and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in
spite of the rural tales have named it "the blasted heath."

The rural tales are queer. They might be even queerer if city men and college
chemists could be interested enough to analyze the water from that disused well,
or the grey dust that no wind seems to disperse. Botanists, too, ought to study
the stunted flora on the borders of that spot, for they might shed light on the
country notion that the blight is spreading - little by little, perhaps an inch a year.
People say the colour of the neighboring herbage is not quite right in the spring,
and that wild things leave queer prints in the light winter snow. Snow never
seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as it is elsewhere. Horses - the few that
are left in this motor age - grow skittish in the silent valley; and hunters cannot
depend on their dogs too near the splotch of greyish dust.

They say the mental influences are very bad, too; numbers went queer in the
years after Nahum's taking, and always they lacked the power to get away. Then
the stronger-minded folk all left the region, and only the foreigners tried to live
in the crumbling old homesteads. They could not stay, though; and one
sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours their wild, weird stories of
whispered magic have given them. Their dreams at night, they protest, are very
horrible in that grotesque country; and surely the very look of the dark realm is
enough to stir a morbid fancy. No traveler has ever escaped a sense of
strangeness in those deep ravines, and artists shiver as they paint thick woods
whose mystery is as much of the spirits as of the eye. I myself am curious about
the sensation I derived from my one lone walk before Ammi told me his tale.
When twilight came I had vaguely wished some clouds would gather, for an odd
timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my soul.

Do not ask me for my opinion. I do not know - that is all. There was no one but
Ammi to question; for Arkham people will not talk about the strange days, and
all three professors who saw the aerolite and its coloured globule are dead. There
were other globules - depend upon that. One must have fed itself and escaped,
and probably there was another which was too late. No doubt it is still down the
well - I know there was something wrong with the sunlight I saw above the



miasmal brink. The rustics say the bhght creeps an inch a year, so perhaps there
is a kind of growth or nourishment even now. But whatever demon hatchhng is
there, it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly spread. Is it
fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air? One of the current Arkham
tales is about fat oaks that shine and move as they ought not to do at night.

What it is, only God knows. In terms of matter I suppose the thing Ammi
described would be called a gas, but this gas obeyed the laws that are not of our
cosmos. This was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and
photographic plates of our observatories. This was no breath from the skies
whose motions and dimensions our astronomers measure or deem too vast to
measure. It was just a colour out of space - a frightful messenger from unformed
realms of infinity beyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere
existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it
throws open before our frenzied eyes.

I doubt very much if Ammi consciously lied to me, and I do not think his tale
was all a freak of madness as the townsfolk had forewarned. Something terrible
came to the hills and valleys on that meteor, and something terrible - though I
know not in what proportion - still remains. I shall be glad to see the water come.
Meanwhile I hope nothing will happen to Ammi. He saw so much of the thing -
and its influence was so insidious. Why has he never been able to move away?
How clearly he recalled those dying words of Nahum's - "Can't git away - draws
ye - ye know summ'at's comin' but tain't no use - ". Ammi is such a good old
man - when the reservoir gang gets to work I must write the chief engineer to
keep a sharp watch on him. I would hate to think of him as the grey, twisted,
brittle monstrosity which persists more and more in troubling my sleep.

The Dunwich Horror

Written in 1928

Published in April 1929 in Weird Tales

Gorgons and Hydras, and Chimaeras - dire stories of Celaeno and the Harpies -
may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition - but they were there
before. They are transcripts, types - the archtypes are in us, and eternal. How else
should the recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come to
affect us all? Is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects, considered
in their capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury? O, least of all!
These terrors are of older standing. They date beyond body - or without the
body, they would have been the same... That the kind of fear here treated is
purely spiritual - that it is strong in proportion as it is objectless on earth, that it
predominates in the period of our sinless infancy - are difficulties the solution of
which might afford some probable insight into our ante-mundane condition, and
a peep at least into the shadowland of pre-existence.

- Charles Lamb: Witches and Other Night-Fears



When a traveller in north central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork at the
junction of Aylesbury pike just beyond Dean's Corners he comes upon a lonely
and curious country.

The ground gets higher, and the brier-bordered stone walls press closer and
closer against the ruts of the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest
belts seem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles and grasses attain a
luxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the planted fields
appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely scattered houses wear a
surprisingly uniform aspect of age, squalor, and dilapidation.

Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled solitary
figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping, rock-
strewn meadows. Those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow
confronted by forbidden things, with which it would be better to have nothing to
do. When a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods,
the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too rounded and
symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky
silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with
which most of them are crowned.



Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude
wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road dips again there
are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes, and indeed almost fears
at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in
abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of
stridently piping bull-frogs. The thin, shining line of the Miskatonic's upper
reaches has an oddly serpent-like suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the
domed hills among which it rises.

As the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone-
crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes
they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which to escape them.
Across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream
and the vertical slope of Round Mountain, and wonders at the cluster of rotting
gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the
neighbouring region. It is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of
the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church
now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet. One
dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it.
Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint, malign odour about
the village street, as of the massed mould and decay of centuries. It is always a
relief to get clear of the place, and to follow the narrow road around the base of
the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike.
Afterwards one sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich.

Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of
horror all the signboards pointing towards it have been taken down. The
scenery, judged by an ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly
beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists. Two centuries ago,
when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship, and strange forest presences was not
laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality. In our
sensible age - since the Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had
the town's and the world's welfare at heart - people shun it without knowing
exactly why. Perhaps one reason - though it cannot apply to uninformed
strangers - is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having gone far along
that path of retrogression so common in many New England backwaters. They
have come to form a race by themselves, with the well-defined mental and
physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding. The average of their intelligence
is woefully low, whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden
murders, incests, and deeds of almost unnameable violence and perversity. The
old gentry, representing the two or three armigerous families which came from
Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay; though
many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names


remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of the Whateleys and Bishops
still send their eldest sons to Harvard and Miskatonic, though those sons seldom
return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors
were born.

No one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror, can say just
what is the matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak of unhallowed rites
and conclaves of the Indians, amidst which they called forbidden shapes of
shadow out of the great rounded hills, and made wild orgiastic prayers that were
answered by loud crackings and rumblings from the ground below. In 1747 the
Reverend Abijah Hoadley, newly come to the Congregational Church at
Dunwich Village, preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of Satan
and his imps; in which he said:

"It must be allow'd, that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of Daemons are
Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny'd; the cursed Voices of Azazel
and Buzrael, of Beelzebub and Belial, being heard now from under Ground by
above a Score of credible Witnesses now living. I myself did not more than a
Fortnight ago catch a very plain Discourse of evill Powers in the Hill behind my
House; wherein there were a Rattling and Rolling, Groaning, Screeching, and
Hissing, such as no Things of this Earth could raise up, and which must needs
have come from those Caves that only black Magick can discover, and only the
Divell unlock".

Mr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon, but the text, printed
in Springfield, is still extant. Noises in the hills continued to be reported from
year to year, and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographers.

Other traditions tell of foul odours near the hill-crowning circles of stone pillars,
and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated
points at the bottom of the great ravines; while still others try to explain the
Devil's Hop Yard - a bleak, blasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade
will grow. Then, too, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous
whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are
psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they time their
eerie cries in unison with the sufferer's struggling breath. If they can catch the
fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they instantly flutter away chittering in
daemoniac laughter; but if they fail, they subside gradually into a disappointed
silence.

These tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come down from
very old times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old - older by far than any of the
communities within thirty miles of it. South of the village one may still spy the


cellar walls and chimney of the ancient Bishop house, which was built before
1700; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern
piece of architecture to be seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the
nineteenth-century factory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the
great rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hilltops, but these are more
generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of skulls and
bones, found within these circles and around the sizeable table-like rock on
Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the burial-
places of the Pocumtucks; even though many ethnologists, disregarding the
absurd improbability of such a theory, persist in believing the remains
Caucasian.

II.

It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set
against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other
dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5 a.m. on Sunday, the second of
February, 1913. This date was recalled because it was Candlemas, which people
in Dunwich curiously observe under another name; and because the noises in the
hills had sounded, and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently,
throughout the night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother
was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino
woman of thirty-five, living with an aged and half-insane father about whom the
most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth. Lavinia
Whateley had no known husband, but according to the custom of the region
made no attempt to disavow the child; concerning the other side of whose
ancestry the country folk might - and did - speculate as widely as they chose. On
the contrary, she seemed strangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who
formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard
to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous
future.

Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a lone
creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read
the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of
Whateleys, and which were fast falling to pieces with age and wormholes. She
had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore
that Old Whateley had taught her. The remote farmhouse had always been
feared because of Old Whateley's reputation for black magic, and the
unexplained death by violence of Mrs Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years
old had not helped to make the place popular. Isolated among strange
influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose day-dreams and singular


occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home
from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared.

There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the
dogs' barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor or midwife
presided at his coming. Neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward,
when Old Wateley drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich Village and
discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at Osborne's general store.
There seemed to be a change in the old man - an added element of furtiveness in
the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of
fear - though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event.
Amidst it all he showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and
what he said of the child's paternity was remembered by many of his hearers
years afterward.

'I dun't keer what folks think - ef Lavinny's boy looked like his pa, he wouldn't
look like nothin' ye expeck. Ye needn't think the only folks is the folks
hereabouts. Lavinny's read some, an' has seed some things the most o' ye only
tell abaout. I calc'late her man is as good a husban' as ye kin find this side of
Aylesbury; an' ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn't ast
no better church weddin' nor her'n. Let me tell ye suthin - some day yew folks'U
hear a child o' Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on the top o' Sentinel Hill!'

The only person who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life were old
Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl Sawyer's common-
law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie's visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her
subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but Zechariah came to lead a
pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley had bought of his son Curtis. This
marked the beginning of a course of cattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur's
family which ended only in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet
at no time did the ramshackle Wateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock.
There came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the
herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farm-house, and
they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic, bloodless-looking
specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper, perhaps sprung from the
unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn,
caused a heavy mortality amongst the Whateley animals. Odd wounds or sores,
having something of the aspect of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle;
and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could
discern similar sores about the throats of the grey, unshaven old man and his
slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.


In the spring after Wilbur's birth Lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the
hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child. Public interest in
the Whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby, and no
one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer
seemed every day to exhibit. Wilbur's growth was indeed phenomenal, for
within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not
usually found in infants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal
sounds showed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant, and no
one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to walk unassisted,
with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove.

It was somewhat after this time - on Hallowe'en - that a great blaze was seen at
midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst
its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop -
of the undecayed Bishops - mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up
that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas
was rounding up a stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he
fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted
almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed
to think they were entirely unclothed. Afterwards he could not be sure about the
boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or
trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without
complete and tightly buttoned attire, the disarrangement or threatened
disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm. His
contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought
very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.

The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that 'Lavinny's black
brat' had commenced to talk, and at the age of only eleven months. His speech
was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary
accents of the region, and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of
which many children of three or four might well be proud. The boy was not
talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly
unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in
what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked
with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds.
His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his
mother's and grandfather's chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose
united with the expression of his large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air
of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however,
exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something
almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin,
coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon disliked even more



decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him were
spiced with references to the bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how the hills
once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of Yog-Sothoth in the midst of a
circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him. Dogs abhorred the
boy, and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their
barking menace.

III.

Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing
the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of
his house - a spacious, peak-roofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in
the rocky hillside, and whose three least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always
been sufficient for himself and his daughter.

There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable
him to accomplish so much hard labour; and though he still babbled dementedly
at times, his carpentry seemed to show the effects of sound calculation. It had
already begun as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool sheds had
been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock. Now,
in restoring the abandoned upper storey of the house, he was a no less thorough
craftsman. His mania showed itself only in his tight boarding-up of all the
windows in the reclaimed section - though many declared that it was a crazy
thing to bother with the reclamation at all.

Less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new
grandson - a room which several callers saw, though no one was ever admitted
to the closely-boarded upper storey. This chamber he lined with tall, firm
shelving, along which he began gradually to arrange, in apparently careful order,
all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had
been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms.

'I made some use of 'em,' he would say as he tried to mend a torn black-letter
page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, 'but the boy's fitten to make
better use of 'em. He'd orter hev 'em as well so as he kin, for they're goin' to be
all of his larnin'.'

When Wilbur was a year and seven months old - in September of 1914 - his size
and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as a child of
four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker. He ran freely about the
fields and hills, and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings. At home he
would pore dilligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather's
books, while Old Whateley would instruct and catechize him through long.



hushed afternoons. By this time the restoration of the house was finished, and
those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made
into a sohd plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end, close
against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was
built up to it from the ground. About the period of this work's completion people
noticed that the old tool-house, tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded
since Wilbur's birth, had been abandoned again. The door swung listlessly open,
and when Earl Sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old
Whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered - such
a stench, he averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the
Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything sane or of
this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk have never been
remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.

The following months were void of visible events, save that everyone swore to a
slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On May Eve of 1915 there
were tremors which even the Aylesbury people felt, whilst the following
Hallowe'en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronized with
bursts of flame - 'them witch Whateleys' doin's' - from the summit of Sentinel
Hill. Wilbur was growing up uncannily, so that he looked like a boy of ten as he
entered his fourth year. He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less
than formerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first time
people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face.
He would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon, and chant in bizarre rhythms
which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror. The aversion
displayed towards him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark, and
he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety. His
occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners
of canine guardians.

The few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the ground floor,
while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up second storey. She
would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there, though once
she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose fish-
pedlar tried the locked door leading to the stairway. That pedlar told the store
loungers at Dunwich Village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that
floor above. The loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of the
cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they recalled tales of
Old Whateley's youth, and of the strange things that are called out of the earth
when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods. It had for
some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole
Whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young Wilbur personally.


In 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the local draft
board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men fit even to be sent
to development camp. The government, alarmed at such signs of wholesale
regional decadence, sent several officers and medical experts to investigate;
conducting a survey which New England newspaper readers may still recall. It
was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of
the Whateleys, and caused the Boston Globe and Arkham Advertiser to print
flamboyant Sunday stories of young Wilbur's precociousness. Old Whateley's
black magic, and the shelves of strange books, the sealed second storey of the
ancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises.
Wilbur was four and a half then, and looked like a lad of fifteen. His lips and
cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his voice had begun to break.

Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place with both sets of reporters and
camera men, and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to
trickle down from the sealed upper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he
had found in the toolshed abandoned when the house was finally repaired; and
like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circle
on the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared, and
grinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers made
so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of
extremely ancient date. The Whateleys had received their visitors with ill-
concealed distaste, though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent
resistance or refusal to talk.

IV.

For a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general
life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their May
Eve and All-Hallows orgies. Twice a year they would light fires on the top of
Sentinel Hill, at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater
and greater violence; while at all seasons there were strange and portentous
doings at the lonely farm-house. In the course of time callers professed to hear
sounds in the sealed upper storey even when all the family were downstairs, and
they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually
sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals but nothing ever came of it, since Dunwich folk are never
anxious to call the outside world's attention to themselves.

About 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and
bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of
carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the sealed upper part, and
from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his


grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor,
leaving only one vast open void between the ground storey and the peaked roof.
They had torn down the great central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range
with a flimsy outside tin stove-pipe.

In the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number of
whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under his
window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great
significance, and told the loungers at Osborn's that he thought his time had
almost come.

'They whistle jest in tune with my breathin' naow,' he said, 'an' I guess they're
gittin' ready to ketch my soul. They know it's a-goin' aout, an' dun't calc'late to
miss it. Yew'll know, boys, arter I'm gone, whether they git me er not. Ef they
dew, they'll keep up a-singin' an' laffin' till break o' day. Ef they dun't they'll
kinder quiet daown like. I expeck them an' the souls they hunts fer hev some
pretty tough tussles sometimes.'

On Lammas Night, 1924, Dr Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned by
Wilbur Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness
and telephoned from Osborn's in the village. He found Old Whateley in a very
grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not
far off. The shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the
bedside, whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting
suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level
beach. The doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds
outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless
message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying
man. It was uncanny and unnatural - too much, thought Dr Houghton, like the
whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent call.

Towards one o'clock Old Whateley gained consciousness, and interrupted his
wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson.

'More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows - an' that grows faster. It'll be
ready to serve ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to Yog-Sothoth with the long
chant that ye'U find on page 751 of the complete edition, an' then put a match to
the prison. Fire from airth can't burn it nohaow.'

He was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of
whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some
indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he added another
sentence or two.


'Feed it reg'lar, Willy, an' mind the quantity; but dun't let it grow too fast fer the
place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to Yog-Sothoth, it's all
over an' no use. Only them from beyont kin make it multiply an' work... Only
them, the old uns as wants to come back. . .'

But speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the way the
whippoorwills followed the change. It was the same for more than an hour,
when the final throaty rattle came. Dr Houghton drew shrunken lids over the
glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence. Lavinia
sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly.

'They didn't git him,' he muttered in his heavy bass voice.

Wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his one-sided
way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant
places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept. He was more and
more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because of certain youthful
disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door; but was always able to
silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of old-time gold which
still, as in his grandfather's time, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle-
buying. He was now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height, having
reached the normal adult limit, seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In
1925, when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic University called upon
him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and three-quarters
feet tall.

Through all the years Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino mother with a
growing contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on May Eve
and Hallowmass; and in 1926 the poor creature complained to Mamie Bishop of
being afraid of him.

'They's more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,' she said, 'an'
naowadays they's more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur Gawd, I dun't
know what he wants nor what he's a-tryin' to dew.'

That Hallowe'en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire burned on
Sentinel Hill as usual; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical
screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to
be assembled near the unlighted Whateley farmhouse. After midnight their shrill
notes burst into a kind of pandemoniac cachinnation which filled all the
countryside, and not until dawn did they finally quiet down. Then they
vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue. What
this meant, no one could quite be certain till later. None of the countryfolk



seemed to have died - but poor Lavinia Whateley, the twisted albino, was never
seen again.

In the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began
moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterwards Earl Sawyer told the
loungers at Osborn's that more carpentry was going on in the Whateley
farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor,
and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather had done
upstairs four years before. He was living in one of the sheds, and Sawyer thought
he seemed unusually worried and tremulous. People generally suspected him of
knowing something about his mother disappearance, and very few ever
approached his neighbourhood now. His height had increased to more than
seven feet, and showed no signs of ceasing its development.

V.

The following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur's first trip
outside the Dunwich region. Correspondence with the Widener Library at
Harvard, the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the British Museum, the University
of Buenos Ayres, and the Library of Miskatonic University at Arkham had failed
to get him the loan of a book he desperately wanted; so at length he set out in
person, shabby, dirty, bearded, and uncouth of dialect, to consult the copy at
Miskatonic, which was the nearest to him geographically. Almost eight feet tall,
and carrying a cheap new valise from Osborne's general store, this dark and
goatish gargoyle appeared one day in Arkham in quest of the dreaded volume
kept under lock and key at the college library - the hideous Necronomicon of the
mad Arab Abdul Alhazred in Olaus Wormius' Latin version, as printed in Spain
in the seventeenth century. He had never seen a city before, but had no thought
save to find his way to the university grounds; where indeed, he passed
heedlessly by the great white-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury
and enmity, and tugged frantically at its stout chaim.

Wilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr Dee's English
version which his grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon receiving access to
the Latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with the aim of
discovering a certain passage which would have come on the 751st page of his
own defective volume. This much he could not civilly refrain from telling the
librarian - the same erudite Henry Armitage (A.M. Miskatonic, Ph.D. Princeton,
Litt.D. Johns Hopkins) who had once called at the farm, and who now politely
plied him with questions. He was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula
or incantation containing the frightful name Yog-Sothoth, and it puzzled him to
find discrepancies, duplications, and ambiguities which made the matter of
determination far from easy. As he copied the formula he finally chose, Dr



Armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages; the left-hand
one of which, in the Latin version, contained such monstrous threats to the peace
and sanity of the world.

Nor is it to be thought (ran the text as Armitage mentally translated it) that man
is either the oldest or the last of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life
and substance walks alone. The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old
Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, they walk serene
and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-
Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past,
present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke
through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where
They had trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one
can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them
near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of
those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts,
differing in likeness from man's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or
substance which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the
Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The
wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness.
They bend the forest and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the
hand that smites. Kadath in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man
knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold
stones whereon Their seal is engraver, but who bath seen the deep frozen city or
the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is
Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. la! Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness
shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them not; and
Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is the key
to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once;
They shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, after winter
summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again.

Dr. Annitage, associating what he was reading with what he had heard of
Dunwich and its brooding presences, and of Wilbur Whateley and his dim,
hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of probable
matricide, felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of the tomb's cold
clamminess. The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of another
planet or dimension; like something only partly of mankind, and linked to black
gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of
force and matter, space and time. Presently Wilbur raised his head and began
speaking in that strange, resonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing
organs unlike the run of mankind's.


'Mr Armitage/ he said, 'I calc'late I've got to take that book home. They's things
in it I've got to try under sarten conditions that I can't git here, en' it 'ud be a
mortal sin to let a red-tape rule hold me up. Let me take it along. Sir, an' I'll swar
they wun't nobody know the difference. I dun't need to tell ye I'll take good keer
of it. It wan't me that put this Dee copy in the shape it is. . .'

He stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian's face, and his own goatish
features grew crafty. Armitage, half-ready to tell him he might make a copy of
what parts he needed, thought suddenly of the possible consequences and
checked himself. There was too much responsibility in giving such a being the
key to such blasphemous outer spheres. Whateley saw how things stood, and
tried to answer lightly.

'Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard won't be so fussy as
yew be.' And without saying more he rose and strode out of the building,
stooping at each doorway.

Armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied
Whateley's gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the
window. He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and recalled the old Sunday
stories in the Advertiser; these things, and the lore he had picked up from
Dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there. Unseen things not of
earth - or at least not of tridimensional earth - rushed foetid and horrible through
New England's glens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain tops. Of this he
had long felt certain. Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible
part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black
dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare. He locked away the
Necronomicon with a shudder of disgust, but the room still reeked with an
unholy and unidentifiable stench. 'As a foulness shall ye know them,' he quoted.
Yes - the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the Whateley
farmhouse less than three years before. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and
ominous, once again, and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his
parentage.

'Inbreeding?' Armitage muttered half-aloud to himself. 'Great God, what
simpletons! Show them Arthur Machen's Great God Pan and they'll think it a
common Dunwich scandal! But what thing - what cursed shapeless influence on
or off this three-dimensional earth - was Wilbur Whateley's father? Born on
Candlemas - nine months after May Eve of 1912, when the talk about the queer
earth noises reached clear to Arkham - what walked on the mountains that May
night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in half-human flesh
and blood?'


During the ensuing weeks Dr Armitage set about to collect all possible data on
Wilbur Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He got in
communication with Dr Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended Old
Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the grandfather's
last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich Village failed to bring
out much that was new; but a close survey of the Necronomicon, in those parts
which Wilbur had sought so avidly, seemed to supply new and terrible clues to
the nature, methods, and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this
planet. Talks with several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many
others elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through
varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear. As the summer
drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors
of the upper Miskatonic valley, and about the monstrous being known to the
human world as Wilbur Whateley.

VI.

The Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928, and
Dr Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue. He had
heard, meanwhile, of Whateley' s grotesque trip to Cambridge, and of his frantic
efforts to borrow or copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener Library. Those
efforts had been in vain, since Armitage had issued warnings of the keenest
intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume. Wilbur had been
shockingly nervous at Cambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally
anxious to get home again, as if he feared the results of being away long.

Early in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small hours of
the third Dr Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild, fierce cries of the
savage watchdog on the college campus. Deep and terrible, the snarling, half-
mad growls and barks continued; always in mounting volume, but with
hideously significant pauses. Then there rang out a scream from a wholly
different throat - such a scream as roused half the sleepers of Arkham and
haunted their dreams ever afterwards - such a scream as could come from no
being born of earth, or wholly of earth.

Armitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to
the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and heard the echoes of
a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library. An open window showed black
and gaping in the moonlight. What had come had indeed completed its entrance;
for the barking and the screaming, now fast fading into a mixed low growling
and moaning, proceeded unmistakably from within. Some instinct warned
Armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see,
so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door.


Among the others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr Francis Morgan, men to
whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two he
motioned to accompany him inside. The inward sounds, except for a watchful,
droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite subsided; but Armitage now
perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the
shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping, as if in unison with
the last breaths of a dying man.

The building was full of a frightful stench which Dr Armitage knew too well, and
the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical reading-room
whence the low whining came. For a second nobody dared to turn on the light,
then Armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch. One of the
three - it is not certain which - shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them
among disordered tables and overturned chairs. Professor Rice declares that he
wholly lost consciousness for an instant, though he did not stumble or fall.

The thing that lay half-bent on its side in a foetid pool of greenish-yellow ichor
and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall, and the dog had torn off all the
clothing and some of the skin. It was not quite dead, but twitched silently and
spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping
of the expectant whippoorwills outside. Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of
apparel were scattered about the room, and just inside the window an empty
canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central desk a
revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it
had not been fired. The thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the
time. It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could
describe it, but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualized by
anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the
common life-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions. It was
partly human, beyond a doubt, with very manlike hands and head, and the
goatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateley's upon it. But the torso and
lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous, so that only generous
clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or
uneradicated.

Above the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where the dog's
rending paws still rested watchfully, had the leathery, reticulated hide of a
crocodile or alligator. The back was piebald with yellow and black, and dimly
suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes. Below the waist, though, it
was the worst; for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began.
The skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a
score of long greenish-grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply.


Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some
cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the hips, deep
set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye;
whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple
annular markings, and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or
throat. The limbs, save for their black fur, roughly resembled the hind legs of
prehistoric earth's giant saurians, and terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were
neither hooves nor claws. When the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles
rhythmically changed colour, as if from some circulatory cause normal to the
non-human greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish
appearance which alternated with a sickly grayish-white in the spaces between
the purple rings. Of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenish-
yellow ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the
stickiness, and left a curious discoloration behind it.

As the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it began to
mumble without turning or raising its head. Dr Armitage made no written
record of its mouthings, but asserts confidently that nothing in English was
uttered. At first the syllables defied all correlation with any speech of earth, but
towards the last there came some disjointed fragments evidently taken from the
Necronomicon, that monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had
perished. These fragments, as Armitage recalls them, ran something like 'N'gai,
n'gha'ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y'hah: Yog-Sothoth, Yog-Sothoth ...' They trailed off
into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in rhythmical crescendos of
unholy anticipation.

Then came a halt in the gasping, and the dog raised its head in a long, lugubrious
howl. A change came over the yellow, goatish face of the prostrate thing, and the
great black eyes fell in appallingly. Outside the window the shrilling of the
whippoorwills had suddenly ceased, and above the murmurs of the gathering
crowd there came the sound of a panic-struck whirring and fluttering. Against
the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers rose and raced from sight, frantic at
that which they had sought for prey.

All at once the dog started up abruptly, gave a frightened bark, and leaped
nervously out of the window by which it had entered. A cry rose from the
crowd, and Dr Armitage shouted to the men outside that no one must be
admitted till the police or medical examiner came. He was thankful that the
windows were just too high to permit of peering in, and drew the dark curtains
carefully down over each one. By this time two policemen had arrived; and Dr
Morgan, meeting them in the vestibule, was urging them for their own sakes to
postpone entrance to the stench-filled reading-room till the examiner came and
the prostrate thing could be covered up.



Meanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor. One need not
describe the kind and rate of shrinkage and disintegration that occurred before
the eyes of Dr Armitage and Professor Rice; but it is permissible to say that, aside
from the external appearance of face and hands, the really human element in
Wilbur Whateley must have been very small. When the medical examiner came,
there was only a sticky whitish mass on the painted boards, and the monstrous
odour had nearly disappeared. Apparently Whateley had had no skull or bony
skeleton; at least, in any true or stable sense. He had taken somewhat after his
unknown father.

VII.

Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror. Formalities were
gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details were duly kept from
press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich and Aylesbury to look up
property and notify any who might be heirs of the late Wilbur Whateley. They
found the countryside in great agitation, both because of the growing rumblings
beneath the domed hills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging,
lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by
Whateley's boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and cattle
during Wilbur's absence, had developed a woefully acute case of nerves. The
officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad
to confine their survey of the deceased's living quarters, the newly mended
sheds, to a single visit. They filed a ponderous report at the courthouse in
Aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress
amongst the innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper
Miskatonic valley.

An almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a huge
ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in
ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the
old bureau which served as its owner's desk. After a week of debate it was sent
to Miskatonic University, together with the deceased's collection of strange
books, for study and possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw
that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold with
which Wilbur and Old Whateley had always paid their debts has yet been
discovered.

It was in the dark of September ninth that the horror broke loose. The hill noises
had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs barked frantically all
night. Early risers on the tenth noticed a peculiar stench in the air. About seven
o'clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at George Corey's, between Cold Spring
Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre


Meadow with the cows. He was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled
into the kitchen; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing
and lowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with
him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs Corey.

'Up thar in the rud beyont the glen. Mis' Corey - they's suthin' ben thar! It smells
like thunder, an' all the bushes an' little trees is pushed back from the rud like
they'd a haouse ben moved along of it. An' that ain't the wust, nuther. They's
prints in the rud. Mis' Corey - great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk
dawon deep like a elephant had ben along, only they's a sight more nor four feet
could make! I looked at one or two afore I run, an' I see every one was covered
with lines spreadin' aout from one place, like as if big palm-leaf fans - twict or
three times as big as any they is - hed of ben paounded dawon into the rud. An'
the smell was awful, like what it is around Wizard Whateley's ol' haouse. . .'

Here he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him
flying home. Mrs Corey, unable to extract more information, began telephoning
the neighbours; thus starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded
the major terrors. When she got Sally Sawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop's, the
nearest place to Whateley's, it became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for
Sally's boy Chauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill towards
Whateley's, and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the
pasturage where Mr Bishop's cows had been left out all night.

'Yes, Mis' Corey,' came Sally's tremulous voice over the party wire, 'Cha'ncey he
just come back a-postin', and couldn't half talk fer bein' scairt! He says Ol'
Whateley's house is all bowed up, with timbers scattered raound like they'd ben
dynamite inside; only the bottom floor ain't through, but is all covered with a
kind o' tar-like stuff that smells awful an' drips daown offen the aidges onto the
graoun' whar the side timbers is blowed away. An' they's awful kinder marks in
the yard, tew - great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead, an' all sticky
with stuff like is on the browed-up haouse. Cha'ncey he says they leads off into
the medders, whar a great swath wider'n a barn is matted daown, an' all the stun
walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes.

'An' he says, says he. Mis' Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth's caows,
frightened ez he was an' faound 'em in the upper pasture nigh the Devil's Hop
Yard in an awful shape. Haff on 'em's clean gone, an' nigh haff o' them that's left
is sucked most dry o' blood, with sores on 'em like they's ben on Whateleys
cattle ever senct Lavinny's black brat was born. Seth hes gone aout naow to look
at 'em, though I'll vaow he won't keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley's!
Cha'ncey didn't look keerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter


it leff the pasturage, but he says he thinks it p'inted towards the glen rud to the
village.

'I tell ye. Mis' Corey, they's suthin' abroad as hadn't orter be abroad, an' I for one
think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to the bad end he deserved, is at the
bottom of the breedin' of it. He wa'n't all human hisself, I alius says to
everybody; an' I think he an' OF Whateley must a raised suthin' in that there
nailed-up haouse as ain't even so human as he was. They's alius ben unseen
things araound Dunwich - livin' things - as ain't human an' ain't good fer human
folks.

'The graoun' was a-talkin' las' night, an' towards mornin' Cha'ncey he heered
the whippoorwills so laoud in Col' Spring Glen he couldn't sleep nun. Then he
thought he heered another faint-like saound over towards Wizard Whateley's - a
kinder rippin' or tearin' o' wood, like some big box er crate was bein' opened fur
off. What with this an' that, he didn't git to sleep at all till sunup, an' no sooner
was he up this mornin', but he's got to go over to Whateley's an' see what's the
matter. He see enough I tell ye. Mis' Corey! This dun't mean no good, an' I think
as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an' do suthin'. I know suthin' awful's
abaout, an' feel my time is nigh, though only Gawd knows jest what it is.

'Did your Luther take accaount o' whar them big tracks led tew? No? Wal, Mis'
Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o' the glen, an' ain't got to your
haouse yet, I calc'late they must go into the glen itself. They would do that. I
alius says Col' Spring Glen ain't no healthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills
an' fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o' Gawd, an' they's them as
says ye kin hear strange things a-rushin' an' a-talkin' in the air dawon thar ef ye
stand in the right place, atween the rock falls an' Bear's Den.'

By that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were trooping
over the roads and meadows between the newmade Whateley ruins and Cold
Spring Glen, examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints, the maimed Bishop
cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse, and the bruised, matted
vegetation of the fields and roadside. Whatever had burst loose upon the world
had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the
banks were bent and broken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the
precipice-hanging underbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an
avalanche, had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical
slope. From below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable foetor; and it
is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue,
rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror in its lair. Three
dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first, but seemed cowed
and reluctant when near the glen. Someone telephoned the news to the


Aylesbury Transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich,
did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon
afterwards reproduced by the Associated Press.

That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded as
stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to remain in open
pasturage. About two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of
the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye's, on the eastern edge of Cold
Spring Glen, and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or
lapping sound from somewhere outside. Mrs Frye proposed telephoning the
neighbours, and Elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood
burst in upon their deliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was
quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The
dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family. Frye lit a
lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death to go out into that
black farmyard. The children and the women-folk whimpered, kept from
screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their
lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful
moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes,
huddled together in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes
died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from
the stable and the daemoniac piping of the late whippoorwills in the glen, Selina
Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second
phase of the horror.

The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative
groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths
of destruction stretched from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints
covered the bare patches of ground, and one side of the old red barn had
completely caved in. Of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified.
Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot.
Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others
maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that
hovered about halfway between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild
suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a
line where tradition ran strong, and his memories of chantings in the great stone
circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur and his grandfather.

Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organize for real
defence. In a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in
the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a repetition of the
barricading of the night before, and a futile, ineffective gesture of loading
muskets and setting pitchforks handily about. Nothing, however, occurred



except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped
that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold
souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did
not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority.

When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was less
huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and the Seth Bishop
households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches
from afar, while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous
tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill. As before, the sides of the road showed a
bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst
the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if
the moving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along
the same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery
saplings led steeply upwards, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even
the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail. Whatever the
horror was, it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality; and as
the investigators climbed round to the hill's summit by safer routes they saw that
the trail ended - or rather, reversed - there.

It was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their
hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May Eve and Hallowmass. Now that
very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the
mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and
foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined
Whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped. Men looked at one another and
muttered. Then they looked down the hill. Apparently the horror had descended
by a route much the same as that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason,
logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who
was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a
plausible explanation.

Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily. The
whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that
many could not sleep, and about 3 A.M. all the party telephones rang
tremulously. Those who took down their receivers heard a fright-mad voice
shriek out, 'Help, oh, my Gawd! ...' and some thought a crashing sound
followed the breaking off of the exclamation. There was nothing more. No one
dared do anything, and no one knew till morning whence the call came. Then
those who had heard it called everyone on the line, and found that only the Fryes
did not reply. The truth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group
of armed men trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was
horrible, yet hardly a surprise. There were more swaths and monstrous prints.



but there was no longer any house. It had caved in Hke an egg-shell, and
amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered. Only a stench and
a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had been erased from Dunwich.

VIII.

In the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror
had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a shelf-lined room in
Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of Wilbur Whateley, delivered
to Miskatonic University for translation had caused much worry and bafflement
among the experts in language both ancient and modern; its very alphabet,
notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily-shaded Arabic used in
Mesopotamia, being absolutely unknown to any available authority. The final
conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet,
giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic
solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every
tongue the writer might conceivably have used. The ancient books taken from
Whateley's quarters, while absorbingly interesting and in several cases
promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and
men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a
heavy tome with an iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet - this one of a
very different cast, and resembling Sanskrit more than anything else. The old
ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of Dr Armitage, both because
of his peculiar interest in the Whateley matter, and because of his wide linguistic
learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the middle ages.

Armitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by
certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times, and which have
inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the Saracenic world.
That question, however, he did not deem vital; since it would be unnecessary to
know the origin of the symbols if, as he suspected, they were used as a cipher in
a modern language. It was his belief that, considering the great amount of text
involved, the writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another
speech than his own, save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations.
Accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that
the bulk of it was in English.

Dr Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that the riddle
was a deep and complex one; and that no simple mode of solution could merit
even a trial. All through late August he fortified himself with the mass lore of
cryptography; drawing upon the fullest resources of his own library, and wading
night after night amidst the arcana of Trithemius' Poligraphia, Giambattista
Porta's De Furtivis Literarum Notis, De Vigenere's Traite des Chiffres, Falconer's


Cryptomenysis Patefacta, Davys' and Thicknesse's eighteenth-century treatises,
and such fairly modern authorities as Blair, van Marten and Kluber's script itself,
and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and
most ingenious of cryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding
letters are arranged like the multiplication table, and the message built up with
arbitrary key-words known only to the initiated. The older authorities seemed
rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage concluded that the code
of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt handed down through a
long line of mystical experimenters. Several times he seemed near daylight, only
to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle. Then, as September approached, the
clouds began to clear. Certain letters, as used in certain parts of the manuscript,
emerged definitely and unmistakably; and it became obvious that the text was
indeed in English.

On the evening of September second the last major barrier gave way, and Dr
Armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur Whateley's
annals. It was in truth a diary, as all had thought; and it was couched in a style
clearly showing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy of the strange
being who wrote it. Almost the first long passage that Armitage deciphered, an
entry dated November 26, 1916, proved highly startling and disquieting. It was
written,he remembered, by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of
twelve or thirteen.

Today learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth (it ran), which did not like, it being
answerable from the hill and not from the air. That upstairs more ahead of me
than I had thought it would be, and is not like to have much earth brain. Shot
Elam Hutchins's collie Jack when he went to bite me, and Elam says he would
kill me if he dast. I guess he won't. Grandfather kept me saying the Dho formula
last night, and I think I saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic poles. I shall go to
those poles when the earth is cleared off, if I can't break through with the Dho-
Hna formula when I commit it. They from the air told me at Sabbat that it will be
years before I can clear off the earth, and I guess grandfather will be dead then,
so I shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the formulas between
the Yr and the Nhhngr. They from outside will help, but they cannot take body
without human blood. That upstairs looks it will have the right cast. I can see it a
little when I make the Voorish sign or blow the powder of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it
is near like them at May Eve on the Hill. The other face may wear off some. I
wonder how I shall look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings
on it. He that came with the Aklo Sabaoth said I may be transfigured there being
much of outside to work on.

Morning found Dr Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful
concentration. He had not left the manuscript all night, but sat at his table under


the electric light turning page after page with shaking hands as fast as he could
decipher the cryptic text. He had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be
home, and when she brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely
dispose of a mouthful. All that day he read on, now and then halted
maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary. Lunch and
dinner were brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either. Toward
the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but soon woke out of a
tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man's
existence that he had uncovered.

On the morning of September fourth Professor Rice and Dr Morgan insisted on
seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and ashen-grey. That evening he
went to bed, but slept only fitfully. Wednesday - the next day - he was back at
the manuscript, and began to take copious notes both from the current sections
and from those he had already deciphered. In the small hours of that night he
slept a little in a easy chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before
dawn. Some time before noon his physician, Dr Hartwell, called to see him and
insisted that he cease work. He refused; intimating that it was of the most vital
importance for him to complete the reading of the diary and promising an
explanation in due course of time. That evening, just as twilight fell, he finished
his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted. His wife, bringing his dinner,
found him in a half-comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn her off
with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken.
Weakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great
envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket. He had
sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in need of medical aid that Dr
Hartwell was summoned at once. As the doctor put him to bed he could only
mutter over and over again, 'But what, in God's name, can we do?'

Dr Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made no
explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative
need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan. His wilder wanderings were
very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that something in a boarded-up
farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation
of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some
terrible elder race of beings from another dimension. He would shout that the
world was in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it away
from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of
entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of aeons ago. At other times he
would call for the dreaded Necronomicon and the Daemonolatreia of Remigius,
in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he
conjured up.


'Stop them, stop theml' he would shout. 'Those Whateleys meant to let them in,
and the worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do something - it's a
blind business, but I know how to make the powder... It hasn't been fed since
the second of August, when Wilbur came here to his death, and at that rate. . .'

But Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and slept off
his disorder that night without developing any real fever. He woke late Friday,
clear of head, though sober with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of
responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to go over to the library and
summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and the rest of that day and evening
the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most
desperate debate. Strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the
stack shelves and from secure places of storage; and diagrams and formulae
were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance. Of scepticism
there was none. All three had seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the
floor in a room of that very building, and after that not one of them could feel
even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman's raving.

Opinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police, and the
negative finally won. There were things involved which simply could not be
believed by those who had not seen a sample, as indeed was made clear during
certain subsequent investigations. Late at night the conference disbanded
without having developed a definite plan, but all day Sunday Armitage was
busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college
laboratory. The more he reflected on the hellish diary, the more he was inclined
to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which
Wilbur Whateley had left behind him - the earth threatening entity which,
unknown to him, was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable
Dunwich horror.

Monday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr Armitage, for the task in hand
required an infinity of research and experiment. Further consultations of the
monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan, and he knew that even
in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain. By Tuesday he had a
definite line of action mapped out, and believed he would try a trip to Dunwich
within a week. Then, on Wednesday, the great shock came. Tucked obscurely
away in a corner of the Arkham Advertiser was a facetious little item from the
Associated Press, telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whisky of
Dunwich had raised up. Armitage, half stunned, could only telephone for Rice
and Morgan. Far into the night they discussed, and the next day was a
whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all. Armitage knew he would be
meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was no other way to annul the
deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before him.


IX.

Friday morning Armitage, Rice, and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich,
arriving at the village about one in the afternoon. The day was pleasant, but even
in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about
the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy ravines of the stricken region.
Now and then on some mountain top a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed
against the sky. From the air of hushed fright at Osborn's store they knew
something hideous had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the
Elmer Frye house and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around
Dunwich, questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing
for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with their
lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks in the Frye yard,
the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous swaths of disturbed
vegetation in various places. The trail up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to
Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister
altar-like stone on the summit.

At length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had come from
Aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of the Frye
tragedy, decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable.
This, however, they found more easily planned than performed; since no sign of
the party could be found in any direction. There had been five of them in a car,
but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the Frye yard. The natives, all of
whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as Armitage
and his companions. Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something and turned
pale, nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep hollow that yawned
close by.

'Gawd,' he gasped, 'I felled 'em not ter go daown into the glen, an' I never
thought nobody'd dew it with them tracks an' that smell an' the whippoorwills
a-screechin' daown thar in the dark o' noonday. . .'

A cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear seemed
strained in a kind of instinctive, unconscious listening. Armitage, now that he
had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work, trembled with the
responsibility he felt to be his. Night would soon fall, and it was then that the
mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course. Negotium
perambuians in tenebris... The old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had
memorized, and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not
memorized. He saw that his electric flashlight was in working order. Rice, beside
him, took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects;



whilst Morgan uncased the big-game rifle on which he reHed despite his
colleague's warnings that no material weapon would be of help.

Armitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind of a
manifestation to expect; but he did not add to the fright of the Dunwich people
by giving any hints or clues. He hoped that it might be conquered without any
revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped. As the shadows
gathered, the natives commenced to disperse homeward, anxious to bar
themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts
were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose.
They shook their heads at the visitors' plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near
the glen; and, as they left, had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again.

There were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills piped
threateningly. Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold Spring Glen,
would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air; such a foetor as all
three of the watchers had smelled once before, when they stood above a dying
thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being. But the
looked-for terror did not appear. Whatever was down there in the glen was
biding its time, and Armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to
attack it in the dark.

Morning came wanly, and the night-sounds ceased. It was a grey, bleak day,
with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to
be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the north-west. The men from
Arkham were undecided what to do. Seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall
beneath one of the few undestroyed Frye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom
of waiting, or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of
their nameless, monstrous quarry. The downpour waxed in heaviness, and
distant peals of thunder sounded from far horizons. Sheet lightning shimmered,
and then a forky bolt flashed near at hand, as if descending into the accursed
glen itself. The sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the storm
would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather.

It was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a confused babel
of voices sounded down the road. Another moment brought to view a frightened
group of more than a dozen men, running, shouting, and even whimpering
hysterically. Someone in the lead began sobbing out words, and the Arkham men
started violently when those words developed a coherent form.

'Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd,' the voice choked out. 'It's a-goin' agin, an' this time
by day! It's aout - it's aout an' a-movin' this very minute, an' only the Lord
knows when it'll be on us all!'



The speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message.

'Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heered the 'phone a-ringin', an' it was
Mis' Corey, George's wife, that hves daown by the junction. She says the hired
boy Luther was aout drivin' in the caows from the storm arter the big boh, when
he see all the trees a-bendin' at the maouth o' the glen - opposite side ter this - an'
smelt the same awful smell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las'
Monday mornin'. An' she says he says they was a swishin' lappin' saound, more
nor what the bendin' trees an' bushes could make, an' all on a suddent the trees
along the rud begun ter git pushed one side, an' they was a awful stompin' an'
splashin' in the mud. But mind ye, Luther he didn't see nothin' at all, only just
the bendin' trees an' underbrush.

'Then fur ahead where Bishop's Brook goes under the rud he heerd a awful
creakin' an' strainin' on the bridge, an' says he could tell the saound o' wood a-
startin' to crack an' split. An' all the whiles he never see a thing, only them trees
an' bushes a-bendin'. An' when the swishin' saound got very fur off - on the rud
towards Wizard Whateley's an' Sentinel Hill - Luther he had the guts ter step up
whar he'd heerd it fust an' look at the graound. It was all mud an' water, an' the
sky was dark, an' the rain was wipin' aout all tracks abaout as fast as could be;
but beginnin' at the glen maouth, whar the trees hed moved, they was still some
o' them awful prints big as bar'ls like he seen Monday.'

At this point the first excited speaker interrupted.

'But that ain't the trouble naow - that was only the start. Zeb here was callin'
folks up an' everybody was a-listenin' in when a call from Seth Bishop's cut in.
His haousekeeper Sally was carryin' on fit to kill - she'd jest seed the trees a-
bendin' beside the rud, an' says they was a kind o' mushy saound, like a
elephant puffin' an' treadin', a-headin' fer the haouse. Then she up an' spoke
suddent of a fearful smell, an' says her boy Cha'ncey was a-screamin' as haow it
was jest like what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin'. An' the
dogs was barkin' an' whinin' awful.

'An' then she let aout a turrible yell, an' says the shed daown the rud had jest
caved in like the storm bed blowed it over, only the wind w'an't strong enough
to dew that. Everybody was a-listenin', an' we could hear lots o' folks on the wire
a-gaspin'. All to onct Sally she yelled again, an' says the front yard picket fence
hed just crumbled up, though they wa'n't no sign o' what done it. Then
everybody on the line could hear Cha'ncey an' old Seth Bishop a-yellin' tew, an'
Sally was shriekin' aout that suthin' heavy hed struck the haouse - not lightnin'
nor nothin', but suthin' heavy again' the front, that kep' a-launchin' itself agin



an' agin, though ye couldn't see nothin' aout the front winders. An' then... an'
then...'

Lines of fright deepened on every face; and Armitage, shaken as he was, had
barely poise enough to prompt the speaker.

'An' then.... Sally she yelled aout, "O help, the haouse is a-cavin' in... an' on the
wire we could hear a turrible crashin' an' a hull flock o' screaming... jes like
when Elmer Frye's place was took, only wuss. . .'

The man paused, and another of the crowd spoke.

'That's all - not a saound nor squeak over the 'phone arter that. Jest still-like. We
that heerd it got aout Fords an' wagons an' rounded up as many able-bodied
men-folks as we could git, at Corey's place, an' come up here ter see what yew
thought best ter dew. Not but what I think it's the Lord's jedgment fer our
iniquities, that no mortal kin ever set aside.'

Armitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke decisively to
the faltering group of frightened rustics.

'We must follow it, boys.' He made his voice as reassuring as possible. 'I believe
there's a chance of putting it out of business. You men know that those
Whateleys were wizards - well, this thing is a thing of wizardry, and must be put
down by the same means. I've seen Wilbur Whateley's diary and read some of
the strange old books he used to read; and I think I know the right kind of spell
to recite to make the thing fade away. Of course, one can't be sure, but we can
always take a chance. It's invisible - 1 knew it would be - but there's powder in
this long-distance sprayer that might make it show up for a second. Later on
we'll try it. It's a frightful thing to have alive, but it isn't as bad as what Wilbur
would have let in if he'd lived longer. You'll never know what the world
escaped. Now we've only this one thing to fight, and it can't multiply. It can,
though, do a lot of harm; so we mustn't hesitate to rid the community of it.

'We must follow it - and the way to begin is to go to the place that has just been
wrecked. Let somebody lead the way - I don't know your roads very well, but
I've an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots. How about it?'

The men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly, pointing
with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain.

'I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop's quickest by cuttin' across the lower medder
here, wadin' the brook at the low place, an' climbin' through Carrier's mowin'




an' the timber-lot beyont. That comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh Seth's -
a leetle t'other side.'

Armitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction indicated; and
most of the natives followed slowly. The sky was growing lighter, and there
were signs that the storm had worn itself away. When Armitage inadvertently
took a wrong direction, Joe Osborn warned him and walked ahead to show the
right one. Courage and confidence were mounting, though the twilight of the
almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay towards the end of their short cut,
and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder,
put these qualities to a severe test.

At length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out. They were
a little beyond the Seth Bishop place, but bent trees and hideously unmistakable
tracks showed what had passed by. Only a few moments were consumed in
surveying the ruins just round the bend. It was the Frye incident all over again,
and nothing dead or living was found in either of the collapsed shells which had
been the Bishop house and barn. No one cared to remain there amidst the stench
and tarry stickiness, but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints
leading on towards the wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned
slopes of Sentinel Hill.

As the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley's abode they shuddered visibly,
and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal. It was no joke tracking down
something as big as a house that one could not see, but that had all the vicious
malevolence of a daemon. Opposite the base of Sentinel Hill the tracks left the
road, and there was a fresh bending and matting visible along the broad swath
marking the monster's former route to and from the summit.

Armitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the
steep green side of the hill. Then he handed the instrument to Morgan, whose
sight was keener. After a moment of gazing Morgan cried out sharply, passing
the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the slope with his finger.
Sawyer, as clumsy as most non-users of optical devices are, fumbled a while; but
eventually focused the lenses with Armitage's aid. When he did so his cry was
less restrained than Morgan's had been.

'Gawd almighty, the grass an' bushes is a'movin'! It's a-goin' up - slow-like -
creepin' - up ter the top this minute, heaven only knows what fur!'

Then the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers. It was one thing to
chase the nameless entity, but quite another to find it. Spells might be all right -
but suppose they weren't? Voices began questioning Armitage about what he




knew of the thing, and no reply seemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel
himself in close proximity to phases of Nature and of being utterly forbidden and
wholly outside the sane experience of mankind.

X.

In the end the three men from Arkham - old, white-bearded Dr Armitage, stocky,
iron-grey Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr Morgan, ascended the mountain
alone. After much patient instruction regarding its focusing and use, they left the
telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road; and as they
climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed
round. It was hard going, and Armitage had to be helped more than once. High
above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker repassed
with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the pursuers were
gaining.

Curtis Whateley - of the undecayed branch - was holding the telescope when the
Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the crowd that the
men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the
swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending.
This, indeed, proved to be true; and the party were seen to gain the minor
elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it.

Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was
adjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about to
happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that his sprayer was expected to
give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three men shut their eyes,
but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the
utmost. He saw that Rice, from the party's point of advantage above and behind
the entity, had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with
marvellous effect.

Those without the telescope saw only an instant's flash of grey cloud - a cloud
about the size of a moderately large building - near the top of the mountain.
Curtis, who held the instrument, dropped it with a piercing shriek into the ankle-
deep mud of the road. He reeled, and would have crumbled to the ground had
not two or three others seized and steadied him. All he could do was moan half-
inaudibly.

'Oh, oh, great Gawd. . . that. . . that. . .'



There was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought to
rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud. Curtis was past all
coherence, and even isolated replies were almost too much for him.

'Bigger'n a barn... all made o' squirmin' ropes... hull thing sort o' shaped like a
hen's egg bigger'n anything with dozens o' legs like hogs-heads that haff shut up
when they step... nothin' solid abaout it - all like jelly, an' made o' sep'rit
wrigglin' ropes pushed clost together... great bulgin' eyes all over it... ten or
twenty maouths or trunks a-stickin' aout all along the sides, big as stove-pipes an
all a-tossin' an openin' an' shuttin'... all grey, with kinder blue or purple rings...
an' Gawd it Heaven - that haff face on top. . .'

This final memory, whatever it was, proved too much for poor Curtis; and he
collapsed completely before he could say more. Fred Farr and Will Hutchins
carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp grass. Henry Wheeler,
trembling, turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see what he might.
Through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures, apparently running
towards the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed. Only these - nothing
more. Then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley
behind, and even in the underbrush of Sentinel Hill itself. It was the piping of
unnumbered whippoorwills, and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a
note of tense and evil expectancy.

Earl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on
the topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar-stone but at a considerable
distance from it. One figure, he said, seemed to be raising its hands above its
head at rhythmic intervals; and as Sawyer mentioned the circumstance the
crowd seemed to hear a faint, half-musical sound from the distance, as if a loud
chant were accompanying the gestures. The weird silhouette on that remote peak
must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness and impressiveness, but no
observer was in a mood for aesthetic appreciation. 'I guess he's sayin' the spell,'
whispered Wheeler as he snatched back the telescope. The whippoorwills were
piping wildly, and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of
the visible ritual.

Suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any
discernible cloud. It was a very peculiar phenomenon, and was plainly marked
by all. A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed strangely
with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky. Lightning flashed
aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents of storm. The
chanting of the men from Arkham now became unmistakable, and Wheeler saw
through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic
incantation. From some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs.


The change in the quahty of the dayhght increased, and the crowd gazed about
the horizon in wonder. A purpHsh darkness, born of nothing more than a
spectral deepening of the sky's blue, pressed down upon the rumbling hills.
Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat brighter than before, and the crowd
fancied that it had showed a certain mistiness around the altar-stone on the
distant height. No one, however, had been using the telescope at that instant. The
whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation, and the men of Dunwich
braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the
atmosphere seemed surcharged.

Without warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which will
never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not from any
human throat were they born, for the organs of man can yield no such acoustic
perversions. Rather would one have said they came from the pit itself, had not
their source been so unmistakably the altar-stone on the peak. It is almost
erroneous to call them sounds at all, since so much of their ghastly, infra-bass
timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear; yet
one must do so, since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of half-
articulate words. They were loud - loud as the rumblings and the thunder above
which they echoed - yet did they come from no visible being. And because
imagination might suggest a conjectural source in the world of non-visible
beings, the huddled crowd at the mountain's base huddled still closer, and
winced as if in expectation of a blow.

'Ygnailh... ygnaiih... thflthkh'ngha.... Yog-Sothoth ...' rang the hideous
croaking out of space. 'Y'bthnk. . . h'ehye - n'grkdl'lh. . .'

The speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful psychic struggle
were going on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at the telescope, but saw only the
three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak, all moving their arms
furiously in strange gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination. From
what black wells of Acherontic fear or feeling, from what unplumbed gulfs of
extra-cosmic consciousness or obscure, long-latent heredity, were those half-
articulate thunder-croakings drawn? Presently they began to gather renewed
force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate frenzy.

'Eh-y-ya-ya-yahaah - e'yayayaaaa... ngh'aaaaa... ngh'aaa... h'yuh... h'yuh...
HELP! HELP! . . .ff - ff - ff - FATHER! FATHER! YOG-SOTHOTH!. . .'

But that was all. The pallid group in the road, still reeling at the indisputably
English syllables that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the
frantic vacancy beside that shocking altar-stone, were never to hear such
syllables again. Instead, they jumped violently at the terrific report which



seemed to rend the hills; the deafening, cataclysmic peal whose source, be it
inner earth or sky, no hearer was ever able to place. A single lightning bolt shot
from the purple zenith to the altar-stone, and a great tidal wave of viewless force
and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside. Trees,
grass, and under-brush were whipped into a fury; and the frightened crowd at
the mountain's base, weakened by the lethal foetor that seemed about to
asphyxiate them, were almost hurled off their feet. Dogs howled from the
distance, green grass and foliage wilted to a curious, sickly yellow-grey, and over
field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills.

The stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again. To this day
there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that
fearsome hill Curtis Whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the
Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once
more brilliant and untainted. They were grave and quiet, and seemed shaken by
memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the
group of natives to a state of cowed quivering. In reply to a jumble of questions
they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital fact.

'The thing has gone for ever,' Armitage said. 'It has been split up into what it
was originally made of, and can never exist again. It was an impossibility in a
normal world. Only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know. It
was like its father - and most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm or
dimension outside our material universe; some vague abyss out of which only
the most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for a
moment on the hills.'

There was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of poor Curtis
Whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so that he put his hands to
his head with a moan. Memory seemed to pick itself up where it had left off, and
the horror of the sight that had prostrated him burst in upon him again.

'Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face - that haff face on top of it... that face with the
red eyes an' crinkly albino hair, an' no chin, like the Whateley s... It was a
octopus, centipede, spider kind o' thing, but they was a haff-shaped man's face
on top of it, an' it looked like Wizard Whateley's, only it was yards an' yards
acrost....'

He paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment
not quite crystallized into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon Whateley, who
wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been silent heretofore,
spoke aloud.



'Fifteen year' gone/ he rambled, 'I heered OY Whateley say as haow some day
we'd hear a child o' Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on the top o' Sentinel
Hill...'

But Joe Osborn interrupted him to question the Arkham men anew.

'What was it, anyhaow, an' haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it aout o'
the air it come from?'

Armitage chose his words very carefully.

'It was - well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn't belong in our part of
space; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself by other laws than
those of our sort of Nature. We have no business calling in such things from
outside, and only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to. There
was some of it in Wilbur Whateley himself - enough to make a devil and a
precocious monster of him, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight.
I'm going to burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you'll dynamite
that altar-stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the
other hills. Things like that brought down the beings those Whateley s were so
fond of - the beings they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race
and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purpose.

'But as to this thing we've just sent back - the Whateley s raised it for a terrible
part in the doings that were to come. It grew fast and big from the same reason
that Wilbur grew fast and big - but it beat him because it had a greater share of
the outsideness in it. You needn't ask how Wilbur called it out of the air. He
didn't call it out. It was his twin brother, but it looked more like the father than
he did.'

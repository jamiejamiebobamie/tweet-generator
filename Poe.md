PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.

In the internal decoration, if not in the external architecture of
their residences, the English are supreme. The Italians have but little
sentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, _meliora probant,
deteriora _sequuntur--the people are too much a race of gadabouts to
maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a
delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The
Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate
fancy. The Scotch are _poor _decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an
indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are
_all _curtains--a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The
Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone
are preposterous.

How this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of
blood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable
thing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display
of wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the
heraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily
understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been
brought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself.

To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade
of costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create
an impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances
themselves--or of taste as regards the proprietor:--this for the reason,
first, that wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition
as constituting a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility
of blood, confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste,
rather avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu
_rivalry may at any time be successfully attempted.

The people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough
diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being
the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,
to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,
looking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two
entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost
of an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly
the sole test of its merit in a decorative point of view--and this test,
once established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily
traceable to the one primitive folly.

There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist
than the interior of what is termed in the United States--that is to
say, in Appallachia--a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual defect
is a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would of
the keeping of a picture--for both the picture and the room are amenable
to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of art; and
very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits of a
painting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber.

A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the
several pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of
adaptation to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic
arrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent--too uninterruptedly
continued--or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines
occur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,
the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.

Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other
decorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an
extensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,
irreconcilable with good taste--the proper quantum, as well as the
proper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect.

Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we
still very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the
apartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the
forms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary
man; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. Yet we have heard
discoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows
who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of
their own _moustaches. _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have a
covering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering
of small--yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As
regards texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the
preterpluperfect tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying
agonies. Touching pattern--a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like
a Riccaree Indian--all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In
brief--distinct grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of
no meaning, _are here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or
representations of well-known objects of any kind, should not be
endured within the limits of Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets,
or curtains, or tapestry, or ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this
nature should be rigidly Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth &
still occasionally seen in the dwellings of the rabble--cloths of huge,
sprawling, and radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious
with all hues, among which no ground is intelligible--these are but the
wicked invention of a race of time-servers and money-lovers--children
of Baal and worshippers of Mammon--Benthams, who, to spare thought
and economize fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then
established joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.

 _Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household
decoration--an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion of
taste just specified., We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.
The former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady
light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild,
or what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows,
will do wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more
lovely thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course,
the astral lamp proper--the lamp of Argand, with its original plain
ground-glass shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The
cut-glass shade is a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with
which we have adopted it, partly on account of its _flashiness,_ but
principally on account of its _greater rest,_ is a good commentary on
the proposition with which we began. It is not too much to say, that the
deliberate employer of a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient
in taste, or blindly subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light
proceeding from one of these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and
painful. It alone is sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the
furniture subjected to its influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is
more than one-half disenchanted beneath its evil eye.

In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its
leading feature is _glitter--_and in that one word how much of all that
is detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes
_pleasing--to children and idiots always so--but in the embellishment
of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth, even strong
_steady _lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning glass
chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle in
our most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of
all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.

The rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before
observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract--has
led us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our
dwellings with great British plates, and then imagine we have done a
fine thing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince
any one who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous
looking-glasses, and especially of large ones. Regarded apart from
its reflection, the mirror presents a continuous, flat, colourless,
unrelieved surface,--a thing always and obviously unpleasant. Considered
as a reflector, it is potent in producing a monstrous and odious
uniformity: and the evil is here aggravated, not in merely direct
proportion with the augmentation of its sources, but in a ratio
constantly increasing. In fact, a room with four or five mirrors
arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show, a room of
no shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter upon
glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing
effects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,
would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be
altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let
the same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be
startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.

It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a
man of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in
it. The corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the
dollar-manufacture. As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is,
therefore, not among _our _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in
Appallachia), for the spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have
seen apartments in the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest”
 or “moderate”] means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with
any of the _or-molu’d _cabinets of our friends across the water. Even
_now_, there is present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious
chamber with whose decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor
lies asleep on a sofa--the weather is cool--the time is near midnight:
we will make a sketch of the room during his slumber.

It is oblong--some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth--a
shape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of
furniture. It has but one door--by no means a wide one--which is at one
end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the
other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor--have deep
recesses--and open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a
crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than
usual. They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue
adapted to the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small
volumes. Without the recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson
silk, fringed with a deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue,
which is the material of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but
the folds of the whole fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and
have an airy appearance), issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich
giltwork, which encircles the room at the junction of the ceiling and
walls. The drapery is thrown open also, or closed, by means of a thick
rope of gold loosely enveloping it, and resolving itself readily into
a knot; no pins or other such devices are apparent. The colours of
the curtains and their fringe--the tints of crimson and gold--appear
everywhere in profusion, and determine the _character _of the room. The
carpet--of Saxony material--is quite half an inch thick, and is of the
same crimson ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord
(like that festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface
of the _ground, _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a
succession of short irregular curves--one occasionally overlaying the
other. The walls are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint,
spotted with small Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent
crimson. Many paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly
landscapes of an imaginative cast--such as the fairy grottoes of
Stanfield, or the lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There
are, nevertheless, three or four female heads, of an ethereal
beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully. The tone of each picture is
warm, but dark. There are no “brilliant effects.” _Repose _speaks in
all. Not one is of small size. Diminutive paintings give that _spotty
_look to a room, which is the blemish of so many a fine work of Art
overtouched. The frames are broad but not deep, and richly carved,
without being _dulled _or filagreed. They have the whole lustre of
burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls, and do not hang off with
cords. The designs themselves are often seen to better advantage in this
latter position, but the general appearance of the chamber is injured.
But one mirror--and this not a very large one--is visible. In shape it
is nearly circular--and it is hung so that a reflection of the person
can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary sitting-places of the
room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson silk, gold-flowered,
form the only seats, with the exception of two light conversation
chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood, also),
without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed altogether of
the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the sofas. This
is also without cover--the drapery of the curtains has been thought
sufficient.. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which bloom a
profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded angles
of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with
highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend.
Some light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson
silk cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently
bound books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except
an Argand lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which
depends from He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain,
and throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all.




A TALE OF JERUSALEM

     Intensos rigidarn in frontern ascendere canos

     Passus erat----
        --Lucan--De Catone

    ----a bristly bore.

“LET us hurry to the walls,” said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and
Simeon the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year
of the world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one--let us hasten
to the ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of
David, and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the
last hour of the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in
fulfilment of the promise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the
lambs for the sacrifices.”

Simeon, Abel-Phittim, and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or
sub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.

“Verily,” replied the Pharisee; “let us hasten: for this generosity
in the heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an
attribute of the worshippers of Baal.”

“‘That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the
Pentateuch,” said Buzi-Ben-Levi, “but that is only toward the people
of Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to
their own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to
allow us lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof
thirty silver shekels per head!”

“Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the
Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,
has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the
altar, to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”

“Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who
belonged to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints
whose manner of _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the
pavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees-a
stumbling-block to less gifted perambulators)--“by the five corners of
that beard which, as a priest, I am forbidden to shave!-have we lived
to see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall
accuse us of appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy
and consecrated elements? Have we lived to see the day when--“’

“Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted
Abel-Phittim’ “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice
or by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest
offerings should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of
heaven can not extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can
turn aside.”

That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and
which bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most
strongly fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep
and lofty hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench,
hewn from the solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength
erected upon its inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular
interspaces, by square towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the
highest one hundred and twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of
the gate of Benjamin, the wall arose by no means from the margin of the
fosse. On the contrary, between the level of the ditch and the basement
of the rampart sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty
cubits, forming part of the precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when
Simeon and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called
Adoni-Bezek-the loftiest of all the turrets around about Jerusalem, and
the usual place of conference with the besieging army-they looked down
upon the camp of the enemy from an eminence excelling by many feet that
of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by several, that of the temple of Belus.

“Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,
“the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore-as the locusts
in the wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of
Adommin.”

“And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine-no,
not one-from Aleph to Tau-from the wilderness to the battlements--who
seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”

“Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a
Roman soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the
regions of Pluto--“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it
has broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince
your gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has
thought fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phoebus,
who is a true god, has been charioted for an hour-and were you not to
be on the ramparts by sunrise? Aedepol! do you think that we, the
conquerors of the world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by
the walls of every kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower
away! I say--and see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in
weight!”

“El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the
centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away
against the temple--“El Elohim!--who is the god Phoebus?--whom doth the
blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of
the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the
Teraphim!--is it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?---or
Ashimah?--or Nibhaz,--or Tartak?--or Adramalech?--or Anamalech?--or
Succoth-Benith?--or Dagon?--or Belial?--or Baal-Perith?--or
Baal-Peor?--or Baal-Zebub?”

“Verily it is neither-but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too
rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang
on the projection of Yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of
the holy things of the sanctuary.”

By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily
laden basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and,
from the giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly
round it; but owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no
distinct view of their operations could be obtained.

Half an hour had already elapsed.

“We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of
this period he looked over into the abyss-“we shall be too late! we
shall be turned out of office by the Katholim.”

 “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim---“no more shall we feast upon the fat
of the land-no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense--our
loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”

“Racal” swore Ben-Levi, “Racal do they mean to defraud us of the
purchase money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the
tabernacle?”

“They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee-----“they
have given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!--and thou,
Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!--for verily the Philistines have either still
hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to place
therein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while
their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.

“Booshoh he!”--as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the
extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible--“Booshoh he!” was the
exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.

*****

“Booshoh he!--for shame!--it is a ram from the thickets of Engedi, and as
rugged as the valley of jehosaphat!”

“It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the
bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes
are more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is
like the honey of Hebron.”

“It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee,
“the heathen have dealt wonderfully with us----let us raise up
our voices in a psalm--let us give thanks on the shawm and on the
psaltery-on the harp and on the huggab-on the cythern and on the
sackbut!”

It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the
Gizbarim that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a hog of no
common size.

“Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,
letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the
Philistines, “El Emanu!-God be with us--it is _the unutterable flesh!”_




THE SPHINX

DURING the dread reign of the Cholera in New York, I had accepted the
invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement
of his _cottage ornee_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around
us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling
in the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books,
we should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful
intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city.
Not a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some
acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily
the loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every
messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.
That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I
could neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was
of a less excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in
spirits, exerted himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical
intellect was not at any time affected by unrealities. To the substances
of terror he was sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no
apprehension.

His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into
which I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain
volumes which I had found in his library. These were of a character to
force into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition
lay latent in my bosom. I had been reading these books without his
knowledge, and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible
impressions which had been made upon my fancy.

A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens--a belief
which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed
to defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions--he
maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,--I
contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity-
that is to say, without apparent traces of suggestion--had in itself the
unmistakable elements of truth, and was entitled to as much respect
as that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of
genius.

The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had
occurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had
in it so much of the portentous character, that I might well have been
excused for regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time
so confounded and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could
make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend.

Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at
an open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a
view of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been
denuded by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its
trees. My thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to
the gloom and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes
from the page, they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an
object--upon some living monster of hideous conformation, which very
rapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally
in the dense forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I
doubted my own sanity--or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and
many minutes passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was
neither mad nor in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which
I distinctly saw, and calmly surveyed through the whole period of
its progress), my readers, I fear, will feel more difficulty in being
convinced of these points than even I did myself.

Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of
the large trees near which it passed--the few giants of the forest which
had escaped the fury of the land-slide--I concluded it to be far larger
than any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line, because
the shape of the monster suggested the idea--the hull of one of our
seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general
outline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a
proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as
the body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was
an immense quantity of black shaggy hair--more than could have been
supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this
hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike
those of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending
forward, parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a
gigantic staff, thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure
crystal and in shape a perfect prism,--it reflected in the most gorgeous
manner the rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a
wedge with the apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs
of wings--each wing nearly one hundred yards in length--one pair being
placed above the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each
scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that
the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But
the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a
Death’s Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and
which was as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of
the body, as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While
I regarded the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance
on its breast, with a feeling or horror and awe--with a sentiment of
forthcoming evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of
the reason, I perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis
suddenly expand themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so
loud and so expressive of wo, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell
and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once,
fainting, to the floor.

Upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend
of what I had seen and heard--and I can scarcely explain what feeling of
repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.

At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we
were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition--I
occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa
near at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to
give him an account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end--at first
laughed heartily--and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as
if my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again
had a distinct view of the monster--to which, with a shout of absolute
terror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly--but maintained
that he saw nothing--although I designated minutely the course of the
creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the hill.

I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an
omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I
threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried
my face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no
longer apparent.

My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his
demeanor, and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the
conformation of the visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied
him on this head, he sighed deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable
burden, and went on to talk, with what I thought a cruel calmness, of
various points of speculative philosophy, which had heretofore formed
subject of discussion between us. I remember his insisting very
especially (among other things) upon the idea that the principle
source of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of
the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an
object, through mere mis-admeasurement of its propinquity. “To estimate
properly, for example,” he said, “the influence to be exercised on
mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of Democracy, the distance
of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should
not fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can you tell me one writer
on the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch
of the subject worthy of discussion at all?”

He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth
one of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to
exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine
print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the
book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.

“But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the
monster, I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you
what it was. In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy
account of the genus Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order
Lepidoptera, of the class of Insecta--or insects. The account runs thus:

“‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic
appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation
of the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of
mandibles and downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior
by a stiff hair; antennae in the form of an elongated club, prismatic;
abdomen pointed, The Death’s--headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror
among the vulgar, at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it
utters, and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”

He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing
himself accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of
beholding “the monster.”

“Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed--“it is reascending the face
of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.
Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,--for
the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some
spider has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the
sixteenth of an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth
of an inch distant from the pupil of my eye.”




HOP-FROG

I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed
to live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to
tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that
his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers.
They all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men,
as well as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or
whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I
have never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean
joker is a rara avis in terris.

About the refinements, or, as he called them, the ‘ghost’ of wit, the
king troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for
breadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake
of it. Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’
‘Gargantua’ to the ‘Zadig’ of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical
jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones.

At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone
out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental ‘powers’ still
retain their ‘fools,’ who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were
expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,
in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.

Our king, as a matter of course, retained his ‘fool.’ The fact is, he
required something in the way of folly--if only to counterbalance
the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers--not to
mention himself.

His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His
value was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also
a dwarf and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days,
as fools; and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through
their days (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both
a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already
observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat,
round, and unwieldy--so that it was no small source of self-gratulation
with our king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed
a triplicate treasure in one person.

I believe the name ‘Hop-Frog’ was not that given to the dwarf by his
sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent
of the several ministers, on account of his inability to walk as
other men do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of
interjectional gait--something between a leap and a wriggle--a movement
that afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to
the king, for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a
constitutional swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was
accounted a capital figure.

But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could
move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the
prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his
arms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled
him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes
were in question, or any thing else to climb. At such exercises he
certainly much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a
frog.

I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog
originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that
no person ever heard of--a vast distance from the court of our king.
Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself
(although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been
forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,
and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious
generals.

Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close
intimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became
sworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport,
was by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta
many services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty
(although a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed
much influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the
benefit of Hop-Frog.

On some grand state occasion--I forgot what--the king determined to
have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,
occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta
were sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so
inventive in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel
characters, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could
be done, it seems, without his assistance.

The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been
fitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could
possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of
expectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed
that everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made
up their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a
month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision
anywhere--except in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why
they hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke.
More probably, they found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to
make up their minds. At all events, time flew; and, as a last resort
they sent for Trippetta and Hop-Frog.

When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found
him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council;
but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that
Hop-Frog was not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to
madness; and madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his
practical jokes, and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as
the king called it) ‘to be merry.’

“Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the
room; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here
Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention.
We want characters--characters, man--something novel--out of the way. We
are wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the wine will
brighten your wits.”

Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these
advances from the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to
be the poor dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his ‘absent
friends’ forced the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell
into the goblet as he took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.

“Ah! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained the
beaker.--“See what a glass of good wine can do! Why, your eyes are
shining already!”

Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect
of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous.
He placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the
company with a half--insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at the
success of the king’s ‘joke.’

“And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man.

“Yes,” said the King; “Come lend us your assistance. Characters, my fine
fellow; we stand in need of characters--all of us--ha! ha! ha!” and
as this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the
seven.

Hop-Frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly.

“Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”

“I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,
abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.

“Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you mean by that?
Ah, I perceive. You are Sulky, and want more wine. Here, drink this!”
 and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who
merely gazed at it, gasping for breath.

“Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the fiends-”

The dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers
smirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat,
and, falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.

The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at
her audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say--how most
becomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a
syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of
the brimming goblet in her face.

The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,
resumed her position at the foot of the table.

There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the
falling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was
interrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which
seemed to come at once from every corner of the room.

“What--what--what are you making that noise for?” demanded the king,
turning furiously to the dwarf.

The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his
intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,
merely ejaculated:

“I--I? How could it have been me?”

“The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the
courtiers. “I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill
upon his cage-wires.”

“True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion;
“but, on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the
gritting of this vagabond’s teeth.”

Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object
to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very
repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow
as much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained
another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at
once, and with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.

“I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very
tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just
after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her
face--just after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was
making that odd noise outside the window, there came into my mind a
capital diversion--one of my own country frolics--often enacted
among us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether.
Unfortunately, however, it requires a company of eight persons and-”

“Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the
coincidence; “eight to a fraction--I and my seven ministers. Come! what
is the diversion?”

“We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs,
and it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”

“We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering
his eyelids.

“The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it
occasions among the women.”

“Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.

“I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all
that to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of
masqueraders will take you for real beasts--and of course, they will be
as much terrified as astonished.”

“Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “Hop-Frog! I will make a
man of you.”

“The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their
jangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.
Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by
eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the
company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately
and gorgeously habited men and women. The contrast is inimitable!”

“It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was
growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.

His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but
effective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the
epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized
world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently
beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to
nature was thus thought to be secured.

The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet
shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage
of the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the
suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the
eight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the
ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flu. A thick
coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar.
A long chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of
the king, and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied;
then about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining
arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each
other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear
natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters,
at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the
present day, by those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in
Borneo.

The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a
circular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only
through a single window at top. At night (the season for which the
apartment was especially designed) it was illuminated principally by a
large chandelier, depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light,
and lowered, or elevated, by means of a counter-balance as usual; but
(in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed outside the cupola
and over the roof.

The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s
superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided
by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was
that, on this occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings
(which, in weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would
have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who,
on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected
to keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier.
Additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the
war, and a flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand
of each of the Caryaides [Caryatides] that stood against the wall--some
fifty or sixty altogether.

The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently
until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders)
before making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking,
however, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together--for the
impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to
stumble as they entered.

The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the
heart of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not
a few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be
beasts of some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many
of the women swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the
precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon
have expiated their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush
was made for the doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked
immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys
had been deposited with him.

While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only
to his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the
pressure of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier
ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have
been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came
within three feet of the floor.

Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the
hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and,
of course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus
situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels,
inciting them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain
at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle
diametrically and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought,
he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend;
and, in an instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was
drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an
inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close
connection, and face to face.

The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure,
from their alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a
well-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the
predicament of the apes.

“Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making
itself easily heard through all the din. “Leave them to me. I fancy I
know them. If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who
they are.”

Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the
wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned,
as he went, to the centre of the room-leaping, with the agility of a
monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the
chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs,
and still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”

And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed
with laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the
chain flew violently up for about thirty feet--dragging with it the
dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in
mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the
chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to
the eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued
to thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover
who they were.

So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a
dead silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. It was broken by
just such a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the
attention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine
in the face of Trippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be
no question as to whence the sound issued. It came from the fang--like
teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at
the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the
upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions.

“Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “Ah, ha! I begin to see
who these people are now!” Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more
closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him,
and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half
a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the
shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken,
and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.

At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the
jester to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as
he made this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into
silence. The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:

“I now see distinctly.” he said, “what manner of people these maskers
are. They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,--a king who
does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors
who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the
jester--and this is my last jest.”

Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which
it adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech
before the work of vengeance was complete. The eight corpses swung in
their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable
mass. The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the
ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light.

It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon,
had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that,
together, they effected their escape to their own country: for neither
was seen again.




THE MAN OF THE CROWD.

     Ce grand malheur, de ne pouvoir être seul.

              _La Bruyère_.

IT was well said of a certain German book that “_er lasst sich nicht
lesen_”--it does not permit itself to be read. There are some secrets
which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in their
beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them
piteously in the eyes--die with despair of heart and convulsion of
throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer
themselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man
takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only
into the grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.

Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the
large bow window of the D----- Coffee-House in London. For some months
I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with returning
strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so
precisely the converse of ennui--moods of the keenest appetency, when
the film from the mental vision departs--the [Greek phrase]--and the
intellect, electrified, surpasses as greatly its every-day condition,
as does the vivid yet candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy
rhetoric of Gorgias. Merely to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived
positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain. I
felt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing. With a cigar in
my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had been amusing myself for the
greater part of the afternoon, now in poring over advertisements, now
in observing the promiscuous company in the room, and now in peering
through the smoky panes into the street.

This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had
been very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came
on, the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well
lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past
the door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before
been in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads
filled me, therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up,
at length, all care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in
contemplation of the scene without.

At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn.
I looked at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their
aggregate relations. Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded
with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air,
gait, visage, and expression of countenance.

By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied
business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their
way through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled
quickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom
of impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still
a numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces,
and talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude
on account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in
their progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled
their gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile
upon the lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled,
they bowed profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with
confusion.--There was nothing very distinctive about these two large
classes beyond what I have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that
order which is pointedly termed the decent. They were undoubtedly
noblemen, merchants, attorneys, tradesmen, stock-jobbers--the Eupatrids
and the common-places of society--men of leisure and men actively
engaged in affairs of their own--conducting business upon their own
responsibility. They did not greatly excite my attention.

The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned
two remarkable divisions. There were the junior clerks of flash
houses--young gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair,
and supercilious lips. Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage,
which may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of
these persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the
perfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore
the cast-off graces of the gentry;--and this, I believe, involves the
best definition of the class.

The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady
old fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. These were known by their
coats and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with
white cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose
or gaiters.--They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right
ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on
end. I observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both
hands, and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and
ancient pattern. Theirs was the affectation of respectability;--if
indeed there be an affectation so honorable.

There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily
understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which
all great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much
inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever
be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. Their voluminousness
of wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at
once.

The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily
recognisable. They wore every variety of dress, from that of the
desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief,
gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate
clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still
all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a
filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two
other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them;--a guarded
lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of
the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers.--Very often,
in company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat
different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be
defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey
upon the public in two battalions--that of the dandies and that of the
military men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and
smiles; of the second frogged coats and frowns.

Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker
and deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes
flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an
expression of abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars
scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had
driven forth into the night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids,
upon whom death had placed a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered
through the mob, looking every one beseechingly in the face, as if in
search of some chance consolation, some lost hope; modest young girls
returning from long and late labor to a cheerless home, and shrinking
more tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians, whose
direct contact, even, could not be avoided; women of the town of all
kinds and of all ages--the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her
womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in Lucian, with the surface
of Parian marble, and the interior filled with filth--the loathsome and
utterly lost leper in rags--the wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed
beldame, making a last effort at youth--the mere child of immature form,
yet, from long association, an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her
trade, and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her
elders in vice; drunkards innumerable and indescribable--some in shreds
and patches, reeling, inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre
eyes--some in whole although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady
swagger, thick sensual lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces--others
clothed in materials which had once been good, and which even now were
scrupulously well brushed--men who walked with a more than naturally
firm and springy step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose
eyes hideously wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as
they strode through the crowd, at every object which came within
their reach; beside these, pie-men, porters, coal--heavers, sweeps;
organ-grinders, monkey-exhibiters and ballad mongers, those who vended
with those who sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every
description, and all full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which
jarred discordantly upon the ear, and gave an aching sensation to the
eye.

As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for
not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its
gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly
portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder
relief, as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its
den,) but the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle
with the dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over
every thing a fitful and garish lustre. All was dark yet splendid--as
that ebony to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.

The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of
individual faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of
light flitted before the window, prevented me from casting more than
a glance upon each visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar
mental state, I could frequently read, even in that brief interval of a
glance, the history of long years.

With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob,
when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old
man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)--a countenance which
at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the
absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. Any thing even remotely
resembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that
my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it,
would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the
fiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey,
to form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly
and paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of
caution, of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of
blood thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror,
of intense--of supreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled,
fascinated. “How wild a history,” I said to myself, “is written within
that bosom!” Then came a craving desire to keep the man in view--to know
more of him. Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and
cane, I made my way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in
the direction which I had seen him take; for he had already disappeared.
With some little difficulty I at length came within sight of him,
approached, and followed him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to
attract his attention.

I had now a good opportunity of examining his person. He was short in
stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally,
were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong
glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of
beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a
closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped
him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These
observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the
stranger whithersoever he should go.

It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city,
soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an
odd effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new
commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the
jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I
did not much regard the rain--the lurking of an old fever in my system
rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a
handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man
held his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here
walked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never
once turning his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and bye he
passed into a cross street, which, although densely filled with people,
was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a
change in his demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with
less object than before--more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed
the way repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so
thick that, at every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely.
The street was a narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for
nearly an hour, during which the passengers had gradually diminished to
about that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the
Park--so vast a difference is there between a London populace and that
of the most frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a
square, brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner
of the stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his
eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon
those who hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I
was surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of
the square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I
astonished to see him repeat the same walk several times--once nearly
detecting me as he came round with a sudden movement.

In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with
far less interruption from passengers than at first. The rain fell fast;
the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. With
a gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a bye-street
comparatively deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he
rushed with an activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so
aged, and which put me to much trouble in pursuit. A few minutes brought
us to a large and busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger
appeared well acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became
apparent, as he forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host
of buyers and sellers.

During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this
place, it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach
without attracting his observation. Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc
over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. At no moment did
he see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing,
spoke no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare.
I was now utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we
should not part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting
him.

A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting
the bazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old
man, and at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He
hurried into the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and
then ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less
lanes, until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we
had started--the street of the D---- Hotel. It no longer wore, however,
the same aspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell
fiercely, and there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale.
He walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a
heavy sigh, turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through
a great variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of
the principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were
thronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while
he threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of
his countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon
his breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that
he now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the
audience--but, upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the
waywardness of his actions.

As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness
and vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a
party of some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one
dropped off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy
lane little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed
lost in thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly
a route which brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very
different from those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome
quarter of London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most
deplorable poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light
of an accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were
seen tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that
scarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them.
The paving-stones lay at random, displaced from their beds by the
rankly-growing grass. Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters.
The whole atmosphere teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the
sounds of human life revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands
of the most abandoned of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro.
The spirits of the old man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near
its death hour. Once more he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly
a corner was turned, a blaze of light burst upon our sight, and we stood
before one of the huge suburban temples of Intemperance--one of the
palaces of the fiend, Gin.

It was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still
pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of
joy the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original
bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object,
among the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before
a rush to the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the
night. It was something even more intense than despair that I then
observed upon the countenance of the singular being whom I had watched
so pertinaciously. Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with
a mad energy, retraced his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty
London. Long and swiftly he fled, while I followed him in the wildest
amazement, resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an
interest all-absorbing. The sun arose while we proceeded, and, when we
had once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town, the
street of the D----- Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle
and activity scarcely inferior to what I had seen on the evening before.
And here, long, amid the momently increasing confusion, did I persist
in my pursuit of the stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and
during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street. And,
as the shades of the second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death,
and, stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly
in the face. He noticed me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I,
ceasing to follow, remained absorbed in contemplation. “This old man,” I
said at length, “is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to
be alone. [page 228:] He is the man of the crowd. It will be in vain to
follow; for I shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst
heart of the world is a grosser book than the ‘Hortulus Animæ,’ {*1} and
perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘er lasst sich
nicht lesen.’”

NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD

A Tale With a Moral.

“_CON tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las
Torres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,
importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_--meaning,
in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure
personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We
presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would
be a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him
there until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely
upon the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a
moral; and, what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered
that every fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a
commentary upon the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s
object was to excite a distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going
a step farther, shows that the intention was to recommend to young
men temperance in eating and drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has
satisfied himself that, by Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin;
by Antinous, Martin Luther; by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general;
and, by the Harpies, the Dutch. Our more modern Scholiasts are
equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in “The
Antediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views in Cock Robin,” and
transcendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it has been shown that
no man can sit down to write without a very profound design. Thus to
authors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for example,
need have no care of his moral. It is there--that is to say, it is
somewhere--and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves.
When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended, and all
that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,” or the
“Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended, and
the rest that he clearly meant to intend:--so that it will all come very
straight in the end.

There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by
certain ignoramuses--that I have never written a moral tale, or, in more
precise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics predestined
to bring me out, and develop my morals:--that is the secret. By and by
the “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them ashamed of their
stupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution--by way
of mitigating the accusations against me--I offer the sad history
appended,--a history about whose obvious moral there can be no question
whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form
the title of the tale. I should have credit for this arrangement--a
far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who reserve the
impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus sneak it in at
the fag end of their fables.

Defuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables, and De
mortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent injunction--even if the dead in
question be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design, therefore,
to vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad dog, it is
true, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was not to
blame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his mother.
She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant--for duties
to her well--regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies, like
tough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the better
for beating--but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be left-handed,
and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left unflogged. The
world revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a baby from
left to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an evil
propensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks
its quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,
and, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was
getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in
my eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when
he had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might
have mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced
beyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand
it no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my
voice, made prophecy of his ruin.

The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age
he used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At
six months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he
was in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies.
At eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the
Temperance pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after
month, until, at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon
wearing moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and
swearing, and for backing his assertions by bets.

Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had
predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown
with his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when
he came to be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without
interlarding it with a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid
wagers--no. I will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon
have laid eggs. With him the thing was a mere formula--nothing more. His
expressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They
were simple if not altogether innocent expletives--imaginative phrases
wherewith to round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and
so,” nobody ever thought of taking him up; but still I could not help
thinking it my duty to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and
so I told him. It was a vulgar one--this I begged him to believe. It was
discountenanced by society--here I said nothing but the truth. It was
forbidden by act of Congress--here I had not the slightest intention
of telling a lie. I remonstrated--but to no purpose. I demonstrated--in
vain. I entreated--he smiled. I implored--he laughed. I preached--he
sneered. I threatened--he swore. I kicked him--he called for the police.
I pulled his nose--he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil his head
that I would not venture to try that experiment again.

Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of
Dammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and
this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about
betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that
I ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a
dollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you
what you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly
still, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”

This latter form seemed to please him best;--perhaps because it involved
the least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious. Had any
one taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have been
small too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure
that I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in
question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of
a man betting his brains like bank-notes:--but this was a point which my
friend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.
In the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up
to “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness
of devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always
displeased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries
force a man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was
something in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to
his offensive expression--something in his manner of enunciation--which
at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy--something
which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted
to call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical,
Mr. Kant pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson
hyperquizzitistical. I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was
in a perilous state. I resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to
save it. I vowed to serve him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is
said to have served the toad,--that is to say, “awaken him to a sense
of his situation.” I addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I
betook myself to remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final
attempt at expostulation.

When I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in
some very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent,
merely looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his
head to one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he
spread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he
winked with the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left.
Then he shut them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so
very wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences.
Then, applying his thumb to his nose, he thought proper to make an
indescribable movement with the rest of his fingers. Finally, setting
his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.

I can call to mind only the beads of his discourse. He would be obliged
to me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He
despised all my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself.
Did I still think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against
his character? Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal
parent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence?
He would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and
he would bind himself to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand
explicitly if my mother knew that I was out. My confusion, he said,
betrayed me, and he would be willing to bet the Devil his head that she
did not.

Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he
left my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him
that he did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been
aroused. For once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I
would have won for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head--for the fact
is, my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from
home.

But Khoda shefa midêhed--Heaven gives relief--as the Mussulmans say when
you tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I had
been insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,
however, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case
of this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer
with my counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But
although I forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself
to give up his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some
of his less reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I
found myself lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with
tears in my eyes:--so profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.

One fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led
us in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to
cross it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and
the archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark.
As we entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and
the interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those
of the unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was
hipped. He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively
lively--so much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy
suspicion. It is not impossible that he was affected with the
transcendentals. I am not well enough versed, however, in the diagnosis
of this disease to speak with decision upon the point; and unhappily
there were none of my friends of the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea,
nevertheless, because of a certain species of austere Merry-Andrewism
which seemed to beset my poor friend, and caused him to make quite a
Tom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping
about under and over every thing that came in his way; now shouting
out, and now lisping out, all manner of odd little and big words, yet
preserving the gravest face in the world all the time. I really could
not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him. At length, having
passed nearly across the bridge, we approached the termination of the
footway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height.
Through this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as usual. But this
turn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted upon leaping
the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the air. Now
this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The best
pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and as
I knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done
by Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a
braggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be
sorry afterward;--for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his head
that he could.

I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some
remonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a
slight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I
started, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into
a nook of the frame--work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a little
lame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more reverend
than his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of black,
but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down
over a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a girl’s.
His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and his two
eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.

Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk
apron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very
odd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a
circumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”

To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact
is, remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known
a Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to
say, therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.

“Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?--the gentleman
says ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;
for, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is
particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he
is pretty sure to look like a fool.

“Dammit,” observed I--although this sounded very much like an oath, than
which nothing was further from my thoughts--“Dammit,” I suggested--“the
gentleman says ‘ahem!’”

I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did
not think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our
speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own
eyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb,
or knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he
could hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with
those simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?--don’t you hear?--the
gentleman says ‘ahem!’”

“You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than
a pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are
you quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and
may as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then--ahem!”

At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased--God only knows why.
He left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a
gracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially,
looking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most
unadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to
imagine.

“I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of
all smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake
of mere form.”

“Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying
a pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable
alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down
the corners of his mouth--“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a
pause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say
after that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud--“this is
quite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt
a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme
induces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable
questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave
him my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”

“Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts,
and looking like a very old sheep in a revery.

The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the
shade of the bridge--a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good
fellow,” said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this
much run. Wait here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may
see whether you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t
omit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will
say ‘one, two, three, and away.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away’”
 Here he took his position by the stile, paused a moment as if in
profound reflection, then looked up and, I thought, smiled very
slightly, then tightened the strings of his apron, then took a long look
at Dammit, and finally gave the word as agreed upon-

            _One--two--three--and--away!_

Punctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong
gallop. The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s--nor yet very low,
like that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure
that he would clear it. And then what if he did not?--ah, that was
the question--what if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the
old gentleman to make any other gentleman jump? The little old
dot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he asks me to jump, I won’t do it,
that’s flat, and I don’t care who the devil he is.” The bridge, as I
say, was arched and covered in, in a very ridiculous manner, and there
was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times--an echo which I
never before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last
words of my remark.

But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an
instant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had
taken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor
of the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he
went up. I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration
just over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually
singular thing that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap
was the affair of a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any
profound reflections, down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back,
on the same side of the stile from which he had started. At the same
instant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed,
having caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into
it from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile. At all this
I was much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for Dammit lay
particularly still, and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and
that he stood in need of my assistance. I hurried up to him and found
that he had received what might be termed a serious injury. The truth
is, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close search I could
not find anywhere; so I determined to take him home and send for the
homoeopathists. In the meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open
an adjacent window of the bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at
once. About five feet just above the top of the turnstile, and crossing
the arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there extended a
flat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of
a series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent.
With the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my
unfortunate friend had come precisely in contact.

He did not long survive his terrible loss. The homoeopathists did not
give him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he
hesitated to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a
lesson to all riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked
a bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses
of his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists.
The scoundrels refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once,
and sold him for dog’s meat.




THOU ART THE MAN

I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma. I will expound
to you--as I alone can--the secret of the enginery that effected the
Rattleborough miracle--the one, the true, the admitted, the undisputed,
the indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to infidelity among
the Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the grandames all
the carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before.

This event--which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of unsuitable
levity--occurred in the summer of 18--. Mr. Barnabas Shuttleworthy--one
of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of the borough--had
been missing for several days under circumstances which gave rise to
suspicion of foul play. Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out from Rattleborough
very early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the avowed intention
of proceeding to the city of-, about fifteen miles distant, and of
returning the night of the same day. Two hours after his departure,
however, his horse returned without him, and without the saddle-bags
which had been strapped on his back at starting. The animal was wounded,
too, and covered with mud. These circumstances naturally gave rise to
much alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was found,
on Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the whole
borough arose en masse to go and look for his body.

The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom
friend of Mr. Shuttleworthy--a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was
universally called, “Charley Goodfellow,” or “Old Charley Goodfellow.”
 Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the
name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never
yet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there
never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly,
honest, good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear
voice, that did you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always
straight in the face, as much as to say: “I have a clear conscience
myself, am afraid of no man, and am altogether above doing a mean
action.” And thus all the hearty, careless, “walking gentlemen” of the
stage are very certain to be called Charles.

Now, “Old Charley Goodfellow,” although he had been in Rattleborough
not longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew
any thing about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood, had
experienced no difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all
the respectable people in the borough. Not a man of them but would have
taken his bare word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women,
there is no saying what they would not have done to oblige him. And all
this came of his having been christened Charles, and of his possessing,
in consequence, that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very “best
letter of recommendation.”

I have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most
respectable and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in
Rattleborough, while “Old Charley Goodfellow” was upon as intimate terms
with him as if he had been his own brother. The two old gentlemen were
next-door neighbours, and, although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever,
visited “Old Charley,” and never was known to take a meal in his house,
still this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly
intimate, as I have just observed; for “Old Charley” never let a day
pass without stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour
came on, and very often he would stay to breakfast or tea, and almost
always to dinner, and then the amount of wine that was made way with by
the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be a difficult thing to
ascertain. “Old Charleys” favorite beverage was Chateau-Margaux, and
it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy’s heart good to see the old fellow
swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one day, when the
wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat out, he said
to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back--“I tell you what it is,
‘Old Charley,’ you are, by all odds, the heartiest old fellow I ever
came across in all my born days; and, since you love to guzzle the wine
at that fashion, I’ll be darned if I don’t have to make thee a present
of a big box of the Chateau-Margaux. Od rot me,”--(Mr. Shuttleworthy had
a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond “Od rot me,” or
“By gosh,” or “By the jolly golly,”)--“Od rot me,” says he, “if I don’t
send an order to town this very afternoon for a double box of the best
that can be got, and I’ll make ye a present of it, I will!--ye needn’t
say a word now--I will, I tell ye, and there’s an end of it; so look out
for it--it will come to hand some of these fine days, precisely when ye
are looking for it the least!” I mention this little bit of liberality
on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy, just by way of showing you how very
intimate an understanding existed between the two friends.

Well, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly
understood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw
any one so profoundly affected as “Old Charley Goodfellow.” When he
first heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without
his master’s saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had
gone clean through and through the poor animal’s chest without quite
killing him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing
man had been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all
over as if he had had a fit of the ague.

At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any
thing at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long
time he endeavored to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy’s other friends from
making a stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile--say for
a week or two, or a month, or two--to see if something wouldn’t turn up,
or if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn’t come in the natural way, and explain
his reasons for sending his horse on before. I dare say you have often
observed this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people
who are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. Their powers of mind
seem to be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like
action, and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed
and “nurse their grief,” as the old ladies express it--that is to say,
ruminate over the trouble.

The people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the
wisdom and discretion of “Old Charley,” that the greater part of them
felt disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business
“until something should turn up,” as the honest old gentleman worded
it; and I believe that, after all this would have been the general
determination, but for the very suspicious interference of Mr.
Shuttleworthy’s nephew, a young man of very dissipated habits,
and otherwise of rather bad character. This nephew, whose name was
Pennifeather, would listen to nothing like reason in the matter of
“lying quiet,” but insisted upon making immediate search for the “corpse
of the murdered man.”--This was the expression he employed; and Mr.
Goodfellow acutely remarked at the time, that it was “a singular
expression, to say no more.” This remark of ‘Old Charley’s,’ too, had
great effect upon the crowd; and one of the party was heard to ask,
very impressively, “how it happened that young Mr. Pennifeather was so
intimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy
uncle’s disappearance, as to feel authorized to assert, distinctly
and unequivocally, that his uncle was ‘a murdered man.’” Hereupon some
little squibbing and bickering occurred among various members of
the crowd, and especially between “Old Charley” and Mr.
Pennifeather--although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no means a
novelty, for no good will had subsisted between the parties for the
last three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr.
Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncles friend for some
alleged excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle’s
house, of which the nephew was an inmate. Upon this occasion “Old
Charley” is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian
charity. He arose from the blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no
attempt at retaliation at all--merely muttering a few words about
“taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunity,”--a
natural and very justifiable ebullition of anger, which meant nothing,
however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner given vent to than forgotten.

However these matters may be (which have no reference to the point
now at issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough,
principally through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length
to the determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search
of the missing Mr. Shuttleworthy. I say they came to this determination
in the first instance. After it had been fully resolved that a search
should be made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the
seekers should disperse--that is to say, distribute themselves in
parties--for the more thorough examination of the region round about. I
forget, however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that
“Old Charley” finally convinced the assembly that this was the most
injudicious plan that could be pursued. Convince them, however, he
did--all except Mr. Pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that
a search should be instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the
burghers en masse, “Old Charley” himself leading the way.

As for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer
than “Old Charley,” whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx;
but, although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and
corners, by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the
neighbourhood, and although the search was incessantly kept up day and
night for nearly a week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be
discovered. When I say no trace, however, I must not be understood to
speak literally, for trace, to some extent, there certainly was.
The poor gentleman had been tracked, by his horses shoes (which were
peculiar), to a spot about three miles to the east of the borough,
on the main road leading to the city. Here the track made off into a
by-path through a piece of woodland--the path coming out again into the
main road, and cutting off about half a mile of the regular distance.
Following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party came at length to a
pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles, to the right of the
lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track was lost sight
of. It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature had here taken
place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much larger and
heavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the pool. This
latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and the party
was upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any result,
when Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of draining
the water off altogether. This project was received with cheers,
and many high compliments to “Old Charley” upon his sagacity and
consideration. As many of the burghers had brought spades with them,
supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse,
the drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the
bottom visible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was
discovered a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one
present immediately recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather. This
waistcoat was much torn and stained with blood, and there were several
persons among the party who had a distinct remembrance of its having
been worn by its owner on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s
departure for the city; while there were others, again, ready to testify
upon oath, if required, that Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question
at any period during the remainder of that memorable day, nor could
any one be found to say that he had seen it upon Mr. P.’s person at any
period at all subsequent to Mr. Shuttleworthy’s disappearance.

Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was
observed, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were
excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked
what he had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word.
Hereupon, the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him,
deserted him at once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his
ancient and avowed enemies for his instantaneous arrest. But, on the
other hand, the magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the
more brilliant lustre through contrast. He made a warm and intensely
eloquent defence of Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once
to his own sincere forgiveness of that wild young gentleman--“the heir
of the worthy Mr. Shuttleworthy,”--for the insult which he (the young
gentleman) had, no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put
upon him (Mr. Goodfellow). “He forgave him for it,” he said, “from the
very bottom of his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from
pushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry
to say, really had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow)
would make every exertion in his power, would employ all the little
eloquence in his possession to--to--to--soften down, as much as he could
conscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly
perplexing piece of business.”

Mr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain,
very much to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your
warm-hearted people are seldom apposite in their observations--they run
into all sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the
hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend--thus, often with the
kindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his
cause than to advance it.

So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of
“Old Charley”; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the
suspected, yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he
uttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the
speaker in the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen
the suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded,
and to arouse against him the fury of the mob.

One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his
allusion to the suspected as “the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr.
Shuttleworthy.” The people had really never thought of this before. They
had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year
or two previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the
nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance
as a matter that was settled--so single-minded a race of beings were the
Rattleburghers; but the remark of “Old Charley” brought them at once to
a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the possibility
of the threats having been nothing more than a threat. And straightway
hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?--a question that
tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon
the young man. And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me to
digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and
simple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated
and misconceived. “Cui bono?” in all the crack novels and elsewhere,--in
those of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of “Cecil,”) a lady who
quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her
learning, “as needed,” upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford,--in all
the crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of
Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little
Latin words cui bono are rendered “to what purpose?” or, (as if quo
bono,) “to what good.” Their true meaning, nevertheless, is “for whose
advantage.” Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. It is a purely
legal phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now
under consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges
upon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to
that from the deed’s accomplishment. Now in the present instance, the
question cui bono? very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. His
uncle had threatened him, after making a will in his favour, with
disinheritance. But the threat had not been actually kept; the original
will, it appeared, had not been altered. Had it been altered, the only
supposable motive for murder on the part of the suspected would
have been the ordinary one of revenge; and even this would have been
counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the good graces of the
uncle. But the will being unaltered, while the threat to alter remained
suspended over the nephew’s head, there appears at once the very
strongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded, very
sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle.

Mr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the
crowd, after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in
custody. On the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to
confirm the suspicion entertained. Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him
to be always a little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run
forward a few paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small
object from the grass. Having quickly examined it he was observed, too,
to make a sort of half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but
this action was noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the
object picked up was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons
at once recognized as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather. Moreover, his
initials were engraved upon the handle. The blade of this knife was open
and bloody.

No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon
reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination.

Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn. The prisoner, being
questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s
disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on
that very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the
immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat
had been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow.

This latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked
permission to be examined. He said that a stern sense of the duty he
owed his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer
to remain silent. Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man
(notwithstanding the latter’s ill-treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow)
had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could
suggest, by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious
in the circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather,
but these circumstances were now altogether too convincing--too damning,
he would hesitate no longer--he would tell all he knew, although his
heart (Mr. Goodfellow’s) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort.
He then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to
Mr. Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman
had mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr. Goodfellow’s), that
his object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an
unusually large sum of money in the “Farmers and Mechanics’ Bank,” and
that, then and there, the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed
to the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the
will originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling. He (the
witness) now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what
he (the witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every
substantial particular. Much to the astonishment of every one present,
Mr. Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was.

The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables
to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. From
this search they almost immediately returned with the well-known
steel-bound, russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been
in the habit of carrying for years. Its valuable contents, however, had
been abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from
the prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their
concealment. Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter.
The constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the
unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials
of his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim.

At this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man
had just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had
received, and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem
examination of the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if
possible, of discovering the ball. This was accordingly done; and, as
if to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr.
Goodfellow, after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was
enabled to detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size,
which, upon trial, was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr.
Pennifeather’s rifle, while it was far too large for that of any other
person in the borough or its vicinity. To render the matter even surer
yet, however, this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right
angles to the usual suture, and upon examination, this seam corresponded
precisely with an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds
acknowledged by the accused himself to be his own property. Upon finding
of this bullet, the examining magistrate refused to listen to
any farther testimony, and immediately committed the prisoner for
trial-declining resolutely to take any bail in the case, although
against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly remonstrated, and
offered to become surety in whatever amount might be required. This
generosity on the part of “Old Charley” was only in accordance with the
whole tenour of his amiable and chivalrous conduct during the entire
period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. In the present instance
the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the excessive warmth of
his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten, when he offered to
go bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr. Goodfellow) did not
possess a single dollar’s worth of property upon the face of the earth.

The result of the committal may be readily foreseen. Mr. Pennifeather,
amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at
the next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence
(strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr.
Goodfellow’s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from
the court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that
the jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict
of “Guilty of murder in the first degree.” Soon afterward the unhappy
wretch received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail
to await the inexorable vengeance of the law.

In the meantime, the noble behavior of “Old Charley Goodfellow,” had
doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough. He became
ten times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the
hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce,
the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto
impelled him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his
own house, when wit and jollity reigned supreme-dampened a little, of
course, by the occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy
fate which impended over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of
the generous host.

One fine day, this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at
the receipt of the following letter:-

 Charles Goodfellow, Esq., Rattleborough
 From H.F.B. & Co.
 Chat. Mar. A--No. 1.--6 doz. bottles (1/2 Gross)

 “Charles Goodfellow, Esquire.

 “Dear Sir--In conformity with an order transmitted to our firm about
 two months since, by our esteemed correspondent, Mr. Barnabus
 Shuttleworthy, we have the honor of forwarding this morning, to your
 address, a double box of Chateau-Margaux of the antelope brand, violet
 seal. Box numbered and marked as per margin.

 “We remain, sir,
         “Your most ob’nt ser’ts,
                 “HOGGS, FROGS, BOGS, & CO.

 “City of--, June 21, 18--.

 “P.S.--The box will reach you by wagon, on the day after your receipt
 of this letter. Our respects to Mr. Shuttleworthy.

                  “H., F., B., & CO.”

The fact is, that Mr. Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr.
Shuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised
Chateau-Margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort
of especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf. He was highly
delighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large
party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of
broaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy’s present. Not that he said
any thing about “the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy” when he issued the
invitations. The fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing
at all. He did not mention to any one--if I remember aright--that he had
received a present of Chateau-Margaux. He merely asked his friends to
come and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich
flavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago,
and of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow. I have often
puzzled myself to imagine why it was that “Old Charley” came to the
conclusion to say nothing about having received the wine from his
old friend, but I could never precisely understand his reason for the
silence, although he had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no
doubt.

The morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly
respectable company at Mr. Goodfellow’s house. Indeed, half the borough
was there,--I myself among the number,--but, much to the vexation of the
host, the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late hour, and when
the sumptuous supper supplied by “Old Charley” had been done very ample
justice by the guests. It came at length, however,--a monstrously big
box of it there was, too--and as the whole party were in excessively
good humor, it was decided, nem. con., that it should be lifted upon the
table and its contents disembowelled forthwith.

No sooner said than done. I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had
the box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not
a few of which were demolished in the scuffle. “Old Charley,” who was
pretty much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a
seat, with an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped
furiously upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep
order “during the ceremony of disinterring the treasure.”

After some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as
very often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence
ensued. Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of
course, “with an infinite deal of pleasure.” I inserted a chisel, and
giving it a few slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew
suddenly off, and at the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting
position, directly facing the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly
putrid corpse of the murdered Mr. Shuttleworthy himself. It gazed for a
few seconds, fixedly and sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre
eyes, full into the countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly,
but clearly and impressively, the words--“Thou art the man!” and then,
falling over the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched
out its limbs quiveringly upon the table.

The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. The rush for the
doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the
room fainted outright through sheer horror. But after the first wild,
shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow.
If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal
agony which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund
with triumph and wine. For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue
of marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to
be turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable,
murderous soul. At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly
out into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his
chair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table,
and in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a
detailed confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was
then imprisoned and doomed to die.

What he recounted was in substance this:--He followed his victim to the
vicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched
its rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book, and,
supposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the
brambles by the pond. Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr.
Shuttleworthy, and thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long
distance off through the woods.

The waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed
by himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr.
Pennifeather. He had also contrived the discovery of the stained
handkerchief and shirt.

Towards the end of the blood-churning recital the words of the guilty
wretch faltered and grew hollow. When the record was finally exhausted,
he arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell-dead.

                   *****

The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although
efficient, were simple indeed. Mr. Goodfellow’s excess of frankness had
disgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first. I was present
when Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which
then arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his
threat of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. I was thus
prepared to view the manoeuvering of “Old Charley” in a very different
light from that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of
Rattleborough. I saw at once that all the criminating discoveries arose,
either directly or indirectly, from himself. But the fact which clearly
opened my eyes to the true state of the case, was the affair of
the bullet, found by Mr. G. in the carcass of the horse. I had not
forgotten, although the Rattleburghers had, that there was a hole where
the ball had entered the horse, and another where it went out. If it
were found in the animal then, after having made its exit, I saw clearly
that it must have been deposited by the person who found it. The bloody
shirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea suggested by the bullet; for
the blood on examination proved to be capital claret, and no more.
When I came to think of these things, and also of the late increase of
liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr. Goodfellow, I entertained
a suspicion which was none the less strong because I kept it altogether
to myself.

In the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse
of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as
divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his
party. The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry
well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the
bottom, I discovered what I sought.

Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two
cronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the
promise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux. Upon this hint I acted. I procured
a stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse,
and deposited the latter in an old wine box-taking care so to double
the body up as to double the whalebone with it. In this manner I had
to press forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with
nails; and I anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were
removed, the top would fly off and the body up.

Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it
as already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine
merchants with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my
servant to wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow’s door, in a barrow, at a
given signal from myself. For the words which I intended the corpse to
speak, I confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their
effect, I counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch.

I believe there is nothing more to be explained. Mr. Pennifeather was
released upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by
the lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever
afterward a new life.

wid the bogthrothing to take up wid the Barronissy, it’s Pathrick that’s
been living like a houly imperor, and gitting the iddication and the
graces. Och! and wouldn’t it be a blessed thing for your spirrits if ye
cud lay your two peepers jist, upon Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt,
when he is all riddy drissed for the hopperer, or stipping into the
Brisky for the drive into the Hyde Park. But it’s the illigant big
figgur that I ave, for the rason o’ which all the ladies fall in love
wid me. Isn’t it my own swate silf now that’ll missure the six fut, and
the three inches more nor that, in me stockins, and that am excadingly
will proportioned all over to match? And it is ralelly more than three
fut and a bit that there is, inny how, of the little ould furrener
Frinchman that lives jist over the way, and that’s a oggling and
a goggling the houl day, (and bad luck to him,) at the purty widdy
Misthress Tracle that’s my own nixt-door neighbor, (God bliss her!)
and a most particuller frind and acquaintance? You percave the little
spalpeen is summat down in the mouth, and wears his lift hand in a
sling, and it’s for that same thing, by yur lave, that I’m going to give
you the good rason.

The truth of the houl matter is jist simple enough; for the very first
day that I com’d from Connaught, and showd my swate little silf in the
strait to the widdy, who was looking through the windy, it was a
gone case althegither with the heart o’ the purty Misthress Tracle.
I percaved it, ye see, all at once, and no mistake, and that’s God’s
truth. First of all it was up wid the windy in a jiffy, and thin she
threw open her two peepers to the itmost, and thin it was a little gould
spy-glass that she clapped tight to one o’ them and divil may burn me
if it didn’t spake to me as plain as a peeper cud spake, and says it,
through the spy-glass: “Och! the tip o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick
O’Grandison, Barronitt, mavourneen; and it’s a nate gintleman that ye
are, sure enough, and it’s mesilf and me forten jist that’ll be at yur
sarvice, dear, inny time o’ day at all at all for the asking.” And it’s
not mesilf ye wud have to be bate in the purliteness; so I made her
a bow that wud ha’ broken yur heart altegither to behould, and thin I
pulled aff me hat with a flourish, and thin I winked at her hard wid
both eyes, as much as to say, “True for you, yer a swate little crature,
Mrs. Tracle, me darlint, and I wish I may be drownthed dead in a bog,
if it’s not mesilf, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, that’ll make a
houl bushel o’ love to yur leddyship, in the twinkling o’ the eye of a
Londonderry purraty.”

And it was the nixt mornin’, sure, jist as I was making up me mind
whither it wouldn’t be the purlite thing to sind a bit o’ writin’ to the
widdy by way of a love-litter, when up com’d the delivery servant wid
an illigant card, and he tould me that the name on it (for I niver could
rade the copperplate printin on account of being lift handed) was all
about Mounseer, the Count, A Goose, Look--aisy, Maiter-di-dauns, and
that the houl of the divilish lingo was the spalpeeny long name of the
little ould furrener Frinchman as lived over the way.

And jist wid that in cum’d the little willian himself, and then he made
me a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had ounly taken the liberty
of doing me the honor of the giving me a call, and thin he went on to
palaver at a great rate, and divil the bit did I comprehind what he wud
be afther the tilling me at all at all, excipting and saving that he
said “pully wou, woolly wou,” and tould me, among a bushel o’ lies, bad
luck to him, that he was mad for the love o’ my widdy Misthress Tracle,
and that my widdy Mrs. Tracle had a puncheon for him.

At the hearin’ of this, ye may swear, though, I was as mad as a
grasshopper, but I remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,
Barronitt, and that it wasn’t althegither gentaal to lit the anger git
the upper hand o’ the purliteness, so I made light o’ the matter and
kipt dark, and got quite sociable wid the little chap, and afther a
while what did he do but ask me to go wid him to the widdy’s, saying he
wud give me the feshionable inthroduction to her leddyship.

“Is it there ye are?” said I thin to mesilf, “and it’s thrue for you,
Pathrick, that ye’re the fortunittest mortal in life. We’ll soon see
now whither it’s your swate silf, or whither it’s little Mounseer
Maiter-di-dauns, that Misthress Tracle is head and ears in the love
wid.”

Wid that we wint aff to the widdy’s, next door, and ye may well say it
was an illigant place; so it was. There was a carpet all over the floor,
and in one corner there was a forty-pinny and a Jew’s harp and the divil
knows what ilse, and in another corner was a sofy, the beautifullest
thing in all natur, and sitting on the sofy, sure enough, there was the
swate little angel, Misthress Tracle.

“The tip o’ the mornin’ to ye,” says I, “Mrs. Tracle,” and thin I made
sich an illigant obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither bewildered
the brain o’ ye.

“Wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud,” says the little furrenner
Frinchman, “and sure Mrs. Tracle,” says he, that he did, “isn’t this
gintleman here jist his reverence Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt,
and isn’t he althegither and entirely the most particular frind and
acquaintance that I have in the houl world?”

And wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and makes the swatest
curthchy nor iver was seen; and thin down she sits like an angel;
and thin, by the powers, it was that little spalpeen Mounseer
Maiter-di-dauns that plumped his silf right down by the right side of
her. Och hon! I ixpicted the two eyes o’ me wud ha cum’d out of my head
on the spot, I was so dispirate mad! Howiver, “Bait who!” says I, after
awhile. “Is it there ye are, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns?” and so down I
plumped on the lift side of her leddyship, to be aven with the willain.
Botheration! it wud ha done your heart good to percave the illigant
double wink that I gived her jist thin right in the face with both eyes.

But the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict me at all
at all, and disperate hard it was he made the love to her leddyship.
“Woully wou,” says he, “Pully wou,” says he, “Plump in the mud,” says he.

“That’s all to no use, Mounseer Frog, mavourneen,” thinks I; and I
talked as hard and as fast as I could all the while, and throth it was
mesilf jist that divarted her leddyship complately and intirely, by
rason of the illigant conversation that I kipt up wid her all about the
dear bogs of Connaught. And by and by she gived me such a swate smile,
from one ind of her mouth to the ither, that it made me as bould as a
pig, and I jist took hould of the ind of her little finger in the most
dillikitest manner in natur, looking at her all the while out o’ the
whites of my eyes.

And then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel, for no sooner
did she obsarve that I was afther the squazing of her flipper, than she
up wid it in a jiffy, and put it away behind her back, jist as much as
to say, “Now thin, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, there’s a bitther chance
for ye, mavourneen, for it’s not altogether the gentaal thing to be
afther the squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little
furrenner Frinchman, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns.”

Wid that I giv’d her a big wink jist to say, “lit Sir Pathrick alone for
the likes o’ them thricks,” and thin I wint aisy to work, and you’d have
died wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly I slipped my right arm
betwane the back o’ the sofy, and the back of her leddyship, and there,
sure enough, I found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say, “the
tip o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt.” And
wasn’t it mesilf, sure, that jist giv’d it the laste little bit of a
squaze in the world, all in the way of a commincement, and not to be too
rough wid her leddyship? and och, botheration, wasn’t it the gentaalest
and dilikittest of all the little squazes that I got in return? “Blood
and thunder, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen,” thinks I to mesilf, “fait it’s
jist the mother’s son of you, and nobody else at all at all, that’s the
handsomest and the fortunittest young bog-throtter that ever cum’d out
of Connaught!” And with that I givd the flipper a big squaze, and a big
squaze it was, by the powers, that her leddyship giv’d to me back. But
it would ha split the seven sides of you wid the laffin’ to
behould, jist then all at once, the consated behavior of Mounseer
Maiter-di-dauns. The likes o’ sich a jabbering, and a smirking, and a
parley-wouing as he begin’d wid her leddyship, niver was known before
upon arth; and divil may burn me if it wasn’t me own very two peepers
that cotch’d him tipping her the wink out of one eye. Och, hon! if it
wasn’t mesilf thin that was mad as a Kilkenny cat I shud like to be
tould who it was!

“Let me infarm you, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns,” said I, as purlite as
iver ye seed, “that it’s not the gintaal thing at all at all, and not
for the likes o’ you inny how, to be afther the oggling and a goggling
at her leddyship in that fashion,” and jist wid that such another squaze
as it was I giv’d her flipper, all as much as to say, “isn’t it Sir
Pathrick now, my jewel, that’ll be able to the proticting o’ you, my
darlint?” and then there cum’d another squaze back, all by way of the
answer. “Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick,” it said as plain as iver a squaze
said in the world, “Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen, and it’s
a proper nate gintleman ye are--that’s God’s truth,” and with that she
opened her two beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha’ cum’d out
of her hid althegither and intirely, and she looked first as mad as a
cat at Mounseer Frog, and thin as smiling as all out o’ doors at mesilf.

“Thin,” says he, the willian, “Och hon! and a wolly-wou, pully-wou,” and
then wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till the divil the bit of
his hid was to be diskivered, and then he let down the two corners of
his purraty-trap, and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could
I git out o’ the spalpeen.

Belave me, my jewel, it was Sir Pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin,
and the more by token that the Frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the
widdy; and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of my flipper, as much
as to say, “At him again, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, mavourneen:” so I
just ripped out wid a big oath, and says I;

“Ye little spalpeeny frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody noun!”--and
jist thin what d’ye think it was that her leddyship did? Troth she
jumped up from the sofy as if she was bit, and made off through
the door, while I turned my head round afther her, in a complate
bewilderment and botheration, and followed her wid me two peepers. You
percave I had a reason of my own for knowing that she couldn’t git down
the stares althegither and intirely; for I knew very well that I had
hould of her hand, for the divil the bit had I iver lit it go. And says
I; “Isn’t it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that ye’ve
been afther the making, yer leddyship? Come back now, that’s a darlint,
and I’ll give ye yur flipper.” But aff she wint down the stairs like a
shot, and thin I turned round to the little Frinch furrenner. Och hon!
if it wasn’t his spalpeeny little paw that I had hould of in my own--why
thin--thin it wasn’t--that’s all.

And maybe it wasn’t mesilf that jist died then outright wid the laffin’,
to behold the little chap when he found out that it wasn’t the widdy at
all at all that he had had hould of all the time, but only Sir Pathrick
O’Grandison. The ould divil himself niver behild sich a long face as he
pet an! As for Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, it wasn’t for
the likes of his riverence to be afther the minding of a thrifle of a
mistake. Ye may jist say, though (for it’s God’s thruth), that afore I
left hould of the flipper of the spalpeen (which was not till afther her
leddyship’s futman had kicked us both down the stairs), I giv’d it such a
nate little broth of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam.

“Woully wou,” says he, “pully wou,” says he--“Cot tam!”

And that’s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift hand in a
sling.



BON-BON.

          Quand un bon vin meuble mon estomac,
          Je suis plus savant que Balzac--          Plus sage que Pibrac;
          Mon brass seul faisant l’attaque
          De la nation Coseaque,
          La mettroit au sac;
          De Charon je passerois le lac,
          En dormant dans son bac;
          J’irois au fier Eac,
          Sans que mon cœur fit tic ni tac,
          Présenter du tabac.
                      French Vaudeville

THAT Pierre Bon-Bon was a _restaurateur_ of uncommon qualifications,
no man who, during the reign of----, frequented the little Câfé in the
cul-de-sac Le Febvre at Rouen, will, I imagine, feel himself at liberty
to dispute. That Pierre Bon-Bon was, in an equal degree, skilled in
the philosophy of that period is, I presume, still more especially
undeniable. His _patés à la fois_ were beyond doubt immaculate; but
what pen can do justice to his essays _sur la Nature_--his thoughts sur
_l’Ame_--his observations _sur l’Esprit?_ If his _omelettes_--if his
_fricandeaux_ were inestimable, what _littérateur_ of that day would not
have given twice as much for an “_Idée de Bon-Bon_” as for all the trash
of “_Idées_” of all the rest of the _savants?_ Bon-Bon had ransacked
libraries which no other man had ransacked--had more than any other
would have entertained a notion of reading--had understood more than
any other would have conceived the possibility of understanding; and
although, while he flourished, there were not wanting some authors at
Rouen to assert “that his _dicta_ evinced neither the purity of the
Academy, nor the depth of the Lyceum”--although, mark me, his doctrines
were by no means very generally comprehended, still it did not follow
that they were difficult of comprehension. It was, I think, on account
of their self-evidency that many persons were led to consider them
abstruse. It is to Bon-Bon--but let this go no farther--it is to Bon-Bon
that Kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics. The former was
indeed not a Platonist, nor strictly speaking an Aristotelian--nor did
he, like the modern Leibnitz, waste those precious hours which might
be employed in the invention of a _fricasée_ or, _facili gradu_, the
analysis of a sensation, in frivolous attempts at reconciling the
obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion. Not at all. Bon-Bon was
Ionic--Bon-Bon was equally Italic. He reasoned _à priori_--He reasoned
also _à posteriori_. His ideas were innate--or otherwise. He believed in
George of Trebizonde--He believed in Bossarion [Bessarion]. Bon-Bon was
emphatically a--Bon-Bonist.

I have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of _restaurateur_. I
would not, however, have any friend of mine imagine that, in fulfilling
his hereditary duties in that line, our hero wanted a proper estimation
of their dignity and importance. Far from it. It was impossible to say
in which branch of his profession he took the greater pride. In his
opinion the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the
capabilities of the stomach. I am not sure, indeed, that he greatly
disagreed with the Chinese, who held that the soul lies in the abdomen.
The Greeks at all events were right, he thought, who employed the same
words for the mind and the diaphragm. (*1) By this I do not mean to
insinuate a charge of gluttony, or indeed any other serious charge
to the prejudice of the metaphysician. If Pierre Bon-Bon had his
failings--and what great man has not a thousand?--if Pierre Bon-Bon,
I say, had his failings, they were failings of very little
importance--faults indeed which, in other tempers, have often been
looked upon rather in the light of virtues. As regards one of these
foibles, I should not even have mentioned it in this history but for the
remarkable prominency--the extreme _alto relievo_--in which it jutted
out from the plane of his general disposition. He could never let slip
an opportunity of making a bargain.

{*1} MD

Not that he was avaricious--no. It was by no means necessary to the
satisfaction of the philosopher, that the bargain should be to his own
proper advantage. Provided a trade could be effected--a trade of any
kind, upon any terms, or under any circumstances--a triumphant smile
was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance, and a
knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity.

At any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as
the one I have just mentioned, should elicit attention and remark.
At the epoch of our narrative, had this peculiarity not attracted
observation, there would have been room for wonder indeed. It was soon
reported that, upon all occasions of the kind, the smile of Bon-Bon was
wont to differ widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh
at his own jokes, or welcome an acquaintance. Hints were thrown out of
an exciting nature; stories were told of perilous bargains made in
a hurry and repented of at leisure; and instances were adduced of
unaccountable capacities, vague longings, and unnatural inclinations
implanted by the author of all evil for wise purposes of his own.

The philosopher had other weaknesses--but they are scarcely worthy our
serious examination. For example, there are few men of extraordinary
profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle.
Whether this inclination be an exciting cause, or rather a valid proof
of such profundity, it is a nice thing to say. Bon-Bon, as far as I can
learn, did not think the subject adapted to minute investigation;--nor
do I. Yet in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical, it
is not to be supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that
intuitive discrimination which was wont to characterize, at one and the
same time, his essais and his omelettes. In his seclusions the Vin de
Bourgogne had its allotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for
the Cotes du Rhone. With him Sauterne was to Medoc what Catullus was to
Homer. He would sport with a syllogism in sipping St. Peray, but unravel
an argument over Clos de Vougeot, and upset a theory in a torrent of
Chambertin. Well had it been if the same quick sense of propriety
had attended him in the peddling propensity to which I have formerly
alluded--but this was by no means the case. Indeed to say the truth,
that trait of mind in the philosophic Bon-Bon did begin at length to
assume a character of strange intensity and mysticism, and appeared
deeply tinctured with the diablerie of his favorite German studies.

To enter the little Cafe in the cul-de-sac Le Febvre was, at the period
of our tale, to enter the sanctum of a man of genius. Bon-Bon was a man
of genius. There was not a sous-cusinier in Rouen, who could not have
told you that Bon-Bon was a man of genius. His very cat knew it, and
forebore to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius. His
large water-dog was acquainted with the fact, and upon the approach
of his master, betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of
deportment, a debasement of the ears, and a dropping of the lower jaw
not altogether unworthy of a dog. It is, however, true that much of this
habitual respect might have been attributed to the personal appearance
of the metaphysician. A distinguished exterior will, I am constrained to
say, have its way even with a beast; and I am willing to allow much
in the outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the
imagination of the quadruped. There is a peculiar majesty about the
atmosphere of the little great--if I may be permitted so equivocal an
expression--which mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times
inefficient in creating. If, however, Bon-Bon was barely three feet in
height, and if his head was diminutively small, still it was impossible
to behold the rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence
nearly bordering upon the sublime. In its size both dogs and men
must have seen a type of his acquirements--in its immensity a fitting
habitation for his immortal soul.

I might here--if it so pleased me--dilate upon the matter of habiliment,
and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician. I might
hint that the hair of our hero was worn short, combed smoothly over
his forehead, and surmounted by a conical-shaped white flannel cap and
tassels--that his pea-green jerkin was not after the fashion of those
worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that day--that the sleeves
were something fuller than the reigning costume permitted--that the
cuffs were turned up, not as usual in that barbarous period, with
cloth of the same quality and color as the garment, but faced in a more
fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of Genoa--that his slippers
were of a bright purple, curiously filigreed, and might have been
manufactured in Japan, but for the exquisite pointing of the toes, and
the brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery--that his breeches
were of the yellow satin-like material called aimable--that his sky-blue
cloak, resembling in form a dressing-wrapper, and richly bestudded all
over with crimson devices, floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like
a mist of the morning--and that his tout ensemble gave rise to the
remarkable words of Benevenuta, the Improvisatrice of Florence, “that
it was difficult to say whether Pierre Bon-Bon was indeed a bird of
Paradise, or rather a very Paradise of perfection.” I might, I say,
expatiate upon all these points if I pleased,--but I forbear, merely
personal details may be left to historical novelists,--they are beneath
the moral dignity of matter-of-fact.

I have said that “to enter the Cafe in the cul-de-sac Le Febvre was to
enter the sanctum of a man of genius”--but then it was only the man
of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the sanctum. A sign,
consisting of a vast folio, swung before the entrance. On one side of
the volume was painted a bottle; on the reverse a pate. On the back
were visible in large letters Oeuvres de Bon-Bon. Thus was delicately
shadowed forth the two-fold occupation of the proprietor.

Upon stepping over the threshold, the whole interior of the building
presented itself to view. A long, low-pitched room, of antique
construction, was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the Cafe. In
a corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician. An army
of curtains, together with a canopy a la Grecque, gave it an air at once
classic and comfortable. In the corner diagonary opposite, appeared,
in direct family communion, the properties of the kitchen and the
bibliotheque. A dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser.
Here lay an ovenful of the latest ethics--there a kettle of dudecimo
melanges. Volumes of German morality were hand and glove with
the gridiron--a toasting-fork might be discovered by the side of
Eusebius--Plato reclined at his ease in the frying-pan--and contemporary
manuscripts were filed away upon the spit.

In other respects the Cafe de Bon-Bon might be said to differ little
from the usual restaurants of the period. A fireplace yawned opposite
the door. On the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a
formidable array of labelled bottles.

It was here, about twelve o’clock one night during the severe winter
the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensity--that Pierre
Bon-Bon, I say, having turned them all out of his house, locked the door
upon them with an oath, and betook himself in no very pacific mood to
the comforts of a leather-bottomed arm-chair, and a fire of blazing
fagots.

It was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or
twice during a century. It snowed fiercely, and the house tottered to
its centre with the floods of wind that, rushing through the crannies
in the wall, and pouring impetuously down the chimney, shook awfully the
curtains of the philosopher’s bed, and disorganized the economy of his
pate-pans and papers. The huge folio sign that swung without, exposed to
the fury of the tempest, creaked ominously, and gave out a moaning sound
from its stanchions of solid oak.

It was in no placid temper, I say, that the metaphysician drew up his
chair to its customary station by the hearth. Many circumstances of a
perplexing nature had occurred during the day, to disturb the serenity
of his meditations. In attempting des oeufs a la Princesse, he had
unfortunately perpetrated an omelette a la Reine; the discovery of a
principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew;
and last, not least, he had been thwarted in one of those admirable
bargains which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing
to a successful termination. But in the chafing of his mind at these
unaccountable vicissitudes, there did not fail to be mingled some degree
of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well
calculated to produce. Whistling to his more immediate vicinity the
large black water-dog we have spoken of before, and settling himself
uneasily in his chair, he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye
toward those distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows
not even the red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in
overcoming. Having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps
unintelligible to himself, he drew close to his seat a small table
covered with books and papers, and soon became absorbed in the task
of retouching a voluminous manuscript, intended for publication on the
morrow.

He had been thus occupied for some minutes when “I am in no hurry,
Monsieur Bon-Bon,” suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment.

“The devil!” ejaculated our hero, starting to his feet, overturning the
table at his side, and staring around him in astonishment.

“Very true,” calmly replied the voice.

“Very true!--what is very true?--how came you here?” vociferated the
metaphysician, as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at
full length upon the bed.

“I was saying,” said the intruder, without attending to the
interrogatives,--“I was saying that I am not at all pushed for
time--that the business upon which I took the liberty of calling, is of
no pressing importance--in short, that I can very well wait until you
have finished your Exposition.”

“My Exposition!--there now!--how do you know?--how came you to
understand that I was writing an Exposition?--good God!”

“Hush!” replied the figure, in a shrill undertone; and, arising quickly
from the bed, he made a single step toward our hero, while an iron lamp
that depended over-head swung convulsively back from his approach.

The philosopher’s amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the
stranger’s dress and appearance. The outlines of his figure, exceedingly
lean, but much above the common height, were rendered minutely distinct,
by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin,
but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago. These
garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than
their present owner. His ankles and wrists were left naked for several
inches. In his shoes, however, a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the
lie to the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress.
His head was bare, and entirely bald, with the exception of a hinder
part, from which depended a queue of considerable length. A pair
of green spectacles, with side glasses, protected his eyes from the
influence of the light, and at the same time prevented our hero from
ascertaining either their color or their conformation. About the entire
person there was no evidence of a shirt, but a white cravat, of filthy
appearance, was tied with extreme precision around the throat and
the ends hanging down formally side by side gave (although I dare say
unintentionally) the idea of an ecclesiastic. Indeed, many other points
both in his appearance and demeanor might have very well sustained a
conception of that nature. Over his left ear, he carried, after the
fashion of a modern clerk, an instrument resembling the stylus of the
ancients. In a breast-pocket of his coat appeared conspicuously a
small black volume fastened with clasps of steel. This book, whether
accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly from the person as to
discover the words “Rituel Catholique” in white letters upon the back.
His entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine--even cadaverously
pale. The forehead was lofty, and deeply furrowed with the ridges
of contemplation. The corners of the mouth were drawn down into an
expression of the most submissive humility. There was also a clasping of
the hands, as he stepped toward our hero--a deep sigh--and altogether a
look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be unequivocally
preposessing. Every shadow of anger faded from the countenance of
the metaphysician, as, having completed a satisfactory survey of his
visiter’s person, he shook him cordially by the hand, and conducted him
to a seat.

There would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous
transition of feeling in the philosopher, to any one of those causes
which might naturally be supposed to have had an influence. Indeed,
Pierre Bon-Bon, from what I have been able to understand of his
disposition, was of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any
speciousness of exterior deportment. It was impossible that so accurate
an observer of men and things should have failed to discover, upon the
moment, the real character of the personage who had thus intruded upon
his hospitality. To say no more, the conformation of his visiter’s feet
was sufficiently remarkable--he maintained lightly upon his head an
inordinately tall hat--there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder
part of his breeches--and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable
fact. Judge, then, with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found
himself thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had
at all times entertained the most unqualified respect. He was, however,
too much of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his
suspicions in regard to the true state of affairs. It was not his cue to
appear at all conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed;
but, by leading his guest into the conversation, to elicit some
important ethical ideas, which might, in obtaining a place in his
contemplated publication, enlighten the human race, and at the same time
immortalize himself--ideas which, I should have added, his visitor’s
great age, and well-known proficiency in the science of morals, might
very well have enabled him to afford.

Actuated by these enlightened views, our hero bade the gentleman sit
down, while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire,
and place upon the now re-established table some bottles of Mousseux.
Having quickly completed these operations, he drew his chair vis-a-vis
to his companion’s, and waited until the latter should open the
conversation. But plans even the most skilfully matured are often
thwarted in the outset of their application--and the restaurateur found
himself nonplussed by the very first words of his visiter’s speech.

“I see you know me, Bon-Bon,” said he; “ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--hi!
hi! hi!--ho! ho! ho!--hu! hu! hu!”--and the devil, dropping at once the
sanctity of his demeanor, opened to its fullest extent a mouth from
ear to ear, so as to display a set of jagged and fang-like teeth,
and, throwing back his head, laughed long, loudly, wickedly, and
uproariously, while the black dog, crouching down upon his haunches,
joined lustily in the chorus, and the tabby cat, flying off at a
tangent, stood up on end, and shrieked in the farthest corner of the
apartment.

Not so the philosopher; he was too much a man of the world either to
laugh like the dog, or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation
of the cat. It must be confessed, he felt a little astonishment to see
the white letters which formed the words “Rituel Catholique” on the
book in his guest’s pocket, momently changing both their color and their
import, and in a few seconds, in place of the original title the words
Regitre des Condamnes blazed forth in characters of red. This startling
circumstance, when Bon-Bon replied to his visiter’s remark, imparted to
his manner an air of embarrassment which probably might, not otherwise
have been observed.

“Why sir,” said the philosopher, “why sir, to speak sincerely--I I
imagine--I have some faint--some very faint idea--of the remarkable
honor-”

“Oh!--ah!--yes!--very well!” interrupted his Majesty; “say no more--I
see how it is.” And hereupon, taking off his green spectacles, he wiped
the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat, and deposited them in
his pocket.

If Bon-Bon had been astonished at the incident of the book, his
amazement was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented
itself to view. In raising his eyes, with a strong feeling of curiosity
to ascertain the color of his guest’s, he found them by no means black,
as he had anticipated--nor gray, as might have been imagined--nor yet
hazel nor blue--nor indeed yellow nor red--nor purple--nor white--nor
green--nor any other color in the heavens above, or in the earth
beneath, or in the waters under the earth. In short, Pierre Bon-Bon
not only saw plainly that his Majesty had no eyes whatsoever, but
could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous
period--for the space where eyes should naturally have been was, I am
constrained to say, simply a dead level of flesh.

It was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some
inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon, and the reply of
his Majesty was at once prompt, dignified, and satisfactory.

“Eyes! my dear Bon-Bon--eyes! did you say?--oh!--ah!--I perceive! The
ridiculous prints, eh, which are in, circulation, have given you a false
idea of my personal appearance? Eyes!--true. Eyes, Pierre Bon-Bon,
are very well in their proper place--that, you would say, is the
head?--right--the head of a worm. To you, likewise, these optics
are indispensable--yet I will convince you that my vision is more
penetrating than your own. There is a cat I see in the corner--a pretty
cat--look at her--observe her well. Now, Bon-Bon, do you behold the
thoughts--the thoughts, I say,--the ideas--the reflections--which are
being engendered in her pericranium? There it is, now--you do not! She
is thinking we admire the length of her tail and the profundity of
her mind. She has just concluded that I am the most distinguished of
ecclesiastics, and that you are the most superficial of metaphysicians.
Thus you see I am not altogether blind; but to one of my profession, the
eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance, liable at any time to
be put out by a toasting-iron, or a pitchfork. To you, I allow, these
optical affairs are indispensable. Endeavor, Bon-Bon, to use them
well;--my vision is the soul.”

Hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table, and
pouring out a bumper for Bon-Bon, requested him to drink it without
scruple, and make himself perfectly at home.

“A clever book that of yours, Pierre,” resumed his Majesty, tapping our
friend knowingly upon the shoulder, as the latter put down his glass
after a thorough compliance with his visiter’s injunction. “A clever
book that of yours, upon my honor. It’s a work after my own heart. Your
arrangement of the matter, I think, however, might be improved, and many
of your notions remind me of Aristotle. That philosopher was one of my
most intimate acquaintances. I liked him as much for his terrible ill
temper, as for his happy knack at making a blunder. There is only one
solid truth in all that he has written, and for that I gave him the hint
out of pure compassion for his absurdity. I suppose, Pierre Bon-Bon, you
very well know to what divine moral truth I am alluding?”

“Cannot say that I--”

“Indeed!--why it was I who told Aristotle that by sneezing, men expelled
superfluous ideas through the proboscis.”

“Which is--hiccup!--undoubtedly the case,” said the metaphysician, while
he poured out for himself another bumper of Mousseux, and offered his
snuff-box to the fingers of his visiter.

“There was Plato, too,” continued his Majesty, modestly declining the
snuff-box and the compliment it implied--“there was Plato, too, for
whom I, at one time, felt all the affection of a friend. You knew Plato,
Bon-Bon?--ah, no, I beg a thousand pardons. He met me at Athens, one
day, in the Parthenon, and told me he was distressed for an idea. I bade
him write, down that o nous estin aulos. He said that he would do so,
and went home, while I stepped over to the pyramids. But my conscience
smote me for having uttered a truth, even to aid a friend, and hastening
back to Athens, I arrived behind the philosopher’s chair as he was
inditing the ‘aulos.’”

“Giving the lambda a fillip with my finger, I turned it upside down. So
the sentence now read ‘o nous estin augos’, and is, you perceive, the
fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics.”

“Were you ever at Rome?” asked the restaurateur, as he finished his
second bottle of Mousseux, and drew from the closet a larger supply of
Chambertin.

“But once, Monsieur Bon-Bon, but once. There was a time,” said the devil,
as if reciting some passage from a book--“there was a time when occurred
an anarchy of five years, during which the republic, bereft of all its
officers, had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people, and
these were not legally vested with any degree of executive power--at
that time, Monsieur Bon-Bon--at that time only I was in Rome, and I have
no earthly acquaintance, consequently, with any of its philosophy.” (*2)

     {*2} Ils ecrivaient sur la Philosophie (_Cicero, Lucretius,
     Seneca_) mais c’etait la Philosophie Grecque.--_Condorcet_.

“What do you think of--what do you think of--hiccup!--Epicurus?”

“What do I think of whom?” said the devil, in astonishment, “you
cannot surely mean to find any fault with Epicurus! What do I think of
Epicurus! Do you mean me, sir?--I am Epicurus! I am the same philosopher
who wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by Diogenes
Laertes.”

“That’s a lie!” said the metaphysician, for the wine had gotten a little
into his head.

“Very well!--very well, sir!--very well, indeed, sir!” said his Majesty,
apparently much flattered.

“That’s a lie!” repeated the restaurateur, dogmatically; “that’s
a--hiccup!--a lie!”

“Well, well, have it your own way!” said the devil, pacifically, and
Bon-Bon, having beaten his Majesty at argument, thought it his duty to
conclude a second bottle of Chambertin.

“As I was saying,” resumed the visiter--“as I was observing a little
while ago, there are some very outre notions in that book of yours
Monsieur Bon-Bon. What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug
about the soul? Pray, sir, what is the soul?”

“The--hiccup!--soul,” replied the metaphysician, referring to his MS.,
“is undoubtedly-”

“No, sir!”

“Indubitably-”

“No, sir!”

“Indisputably-”

“No, sir!”

“Evidently-”

“No, sir!”

“Incontrovertibly-”

“No, sir!”

“Hiccup!--”

“No, sir!”

“And beyond all question, a-”

“No sir, the soul is no such thing!” (Here the philosopher, looking
daggers, took occasion to make an end, upon the spot, of his third
bottle of Chambertin.)

“Then--hic-cup!--pray, sir--what--what is it?”

“That is neither here nor there, Monsieur Bon-Bon,” replied his Majesty,
musingly. “I have tasted--that is to say, I have known some very bad
souls, and some too--pretty good ones.” Here he smacked his lips, and,
having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket,
was seized with a violent fit of sneezing.

He continued.

“There was the soul of Cratinus--passable: Aristophanes--racy:
Plato--exquisite--not your Plato, but Plato the comic poet; your Plato
would have turned the stomach of Cerberus--faugh! Then let me see! there
were Naevius, and Andronicus, and Plautus, and Terentius. Then there
were Lucilius, and Catullus, and Naso, and Quintus Flaccus,--dear
Quinty! as I called him when he sung a seculare for my amusement, while
I toasted him, in pure good humor, on a fork. But they want flavor,
these Romans. One fat Greek is worth a dozen of them, and besides will
keep, which cannot be said of a Quirite.--Let us taste your Sauterne.”

Bon-Bon had by this time made up his mind to nil admirari and endeavored
to hand down the bottles in question. He was, however, conscious of a
strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail. Of this,
although extremely indecent in his Majesty, the philosopher took no
notice:--simply kicking the dog, and requesting him to be quiet. The
visiter continued:

“I found that Horace tasted very much like Aristotle;--you know I am
fond of variety. Terentius I could not have told from Menander. Naso, to
my astonishment, was Nicander in disguise. Virgilius had a strong twang
of Theocritus. Martial put me much in mind of Archilochus--and Titus
Livius was positively Polybius and none other.”

“Hic-cup!” here replied Bon-Bon, and his majesty proceeded:

“But if I have a penchant, Monsieur Bon-Bon--if I have a penchant, it
is for a philosopher. Yet, let me tell you, sir, it is not every dev--I
mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher.
Long ones are not good; and the best, if not carefully shelled, are apt
to be a little rancid on account of the gall!”

“Shelled!”

“I mean taken out of the carcass.”

“What do you think of a--hic-cup!--physician?”

“Don’t mention them!--ugh! ugh! ugh!” (Here his Majesty retched
violently.) “I never tasted but one--that rascal Hippocrates!--smelt of
asafoetida--ugh! ugh! ugh!--caught a wretched cold washing him in the
Styx--and after all he gave me the cholera morbus.”

“The--hiccup--wretch!” ejaculated Bon-Bon, “the--hic-cup!--absorption of
a pill-box!”--and the philosopher dropped a tear.

“After all,” continued the visiter, “after all, if a dev--if a gentleman
wishes to live, he must have more talents than one or two; and with us a
fat face is an evidence of diplomacy.”

“How so?”

“Why, we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions. You must know
that, in a climate so sultry as mine, it is frequently impossible to
keep a spirit alive for more than two or three hours; and after death,
unless pickled immediately (and a pickled spirit is not good),
they will--smell--you understand, eh? Putrefaction is always to be
apprehended when the souls are consigned to us in the usual way.”

“Hiccup!--hiccup!--good God! how do you manage?”

Here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence, and
the devil half started from his seat;--however, with a slight sigh, he
recovered his composure, merely saying to our hero in a low tone: “I
tell you what, Pierre Bon-Bon, we must have no more swearing.”

The host swallowed another bumper, by way of denoting thorough
comprehension and acquiescence, and the visiter continued.

“Why, there are several ways of managing. The most of us starve: some
put up with the pickle: for my part I purchase my spirits vivente
corpore, in which case I find they keep very well.”

“But the body!--hiccup!--the body!”

“The body, the body--well, what of the body?--oh! ah! I perceive. Why,
sir, the body is not at all affected by the transaction. I have made
innumerable purchases of the kind in my day, and the parties never
experienced any inconvenience. There were Cain and Nimrod, and Nero, and
Caligula, and Dionysius, and Pisistratus, and--and a thousand others,
who never knew what it was to have a soul during the latter part of
their lives; yet, sir, these men adorned society. Why possession of
his faculties, mental and corporeal? Who writes a keener epigram?
Who reasons more wittily? Who--but stay! I have his agreement in my
pocket-book.”

Thus saying, he produced a red leather wallet, and took from it a number
of papers. Upon some of these Bon-Bon caught a glimpse of the letters
Machi--Maza--Robesp--with the words Caligula, George, Elizabeth. His
Majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment, and from it read aloud the
following words:

“In consideration of certain mental endowments which it is unnecessary
to specify, and in further consideration of one thousand louis d’or, I
being aged one year and one month, do hereby make over to the bearer
of this agreement all my right, title, and appurtenance in the shadow
called my soul. (Signed) A....” {*4} (Here His Majesty repeated a name
which I did not feel justified in indicating more unequivocally.)

{*4} Quere-Arouet?

“A clever fellow that,” resumed he; “but like you, Monsieur Bon-Bon,
he was mistaken about the soul. The soul a shadow, truly! The soul a
shadow; Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--hu! hu! hu! Only think of a fricasseed
shadow!”

“Only think--hiccup!--of a fricasseed shadow!” exclaimed our hero,
whose faculties were becoming much illuminated by the profundity of his
Majesty’s discourse.

“Only think of a hiccup!--fricasseed shadow!! Now,
damme!--hiccup!--humph! If I would have been such
a--hiccup!--nincompoop! My soul, Mr.--humph!”

“Your soul, Monsieur Bon-Bon?”

“Yes, sir--hiccup!--my soul is-”

“What, sir?”

“No shadow, damme!”

“Did you mean to say-”

“Yes, sir, my soul is--hiccup!--humph!--yes, sir.”

“Did you not intend to assert-”

“My soul is--hiccup!--peculiarly qualified for--hiccup!--a-”

“What, sir?”

“Stew.”

“Ha!”

“Soufflee.”

“Eh!”

“Fricassee.”

“Indeed!”

“Ragout and fricandeau--and see here, my good fellow! I’ll let you have
it--hiccup!--a bargain.” Here the philosopher slapped his Majesty upon
the back.

“Couldn’t think of such a thing,” said the latter calmly, at the same
time rising from his seat. The metaphysician stared.

“Am supplied at present,” said his Majesty.

“Hiccup--e-h?” said the philosopher.

“Have no funds on hand.”

“What?”

“Besides, very unhandsome in me--”

“Sir!”

“To take advantage of-”

“Hiccup!”

“Your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation.”

Here the visiter bowed and withdrew--in what manner could not precisely
be ascertained--but in a well-concerted effort to discharge a bottle
at “the villain,” the slender chain was severed that depended from the
ceiling, and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the lamp.




SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.

THE _symposium_ of the preceding evening had been a little too much
for my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.
Instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed,
it occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a
mouthful of supper and go immediately to bed.

A light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More
than a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still,
there can be no material objection to two. And really between two and
three, there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps,
upon four. My wife will have it five;--but, clearly, she has confounded
two very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to
admit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,
without which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.

Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the
serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon
the pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a
profound slumber forthwith.

But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have
completed my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the
street-door bell, and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which
awakened me at once. In a minute afterward, and while I was still
rubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note, from my old friend,
Doctor Ponnonner. It ran thus:

      “Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you
 receive this. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering
 diplomacy, I have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum,
 to my examination of the Mummy--you know the one I mean. I have
 permission to unswathe it and open it, if desirable. A few friends only
 will be present--you, of course. The Mummy is now at my house, and we
 shall begin to unroll it at eleven to-night.

           “Yours, ever,

                   PONNONNER.

By the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was
as wide awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy,
overthrowing all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly
marvellous; and set off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.

There I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me
with much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and
the moment I entered its examination was commenced.

It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain
Arthur Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in
the Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.
The grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban
sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more
numerous illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber
from which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such
illustrations; the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings
and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich patterns,
indicated the vast wealth of the deceased.

The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same
condition in which Captain Sabretash had found it;--that is to say,
the coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,
subject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore,
the complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very
rarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident,
at once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good
fortune.

Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven
feet long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It
was oblong--not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to
be the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we
found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_, composed
of papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing
funeral scenes, and other mournful subjects--interspersed among which,
in every variety of position, were certain series of hieroglyphical
characters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed. By good
luck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in
translating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the
word _Allamistakeo_.

We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury;
but having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,
coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,
but resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between
the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the
colors of the interior box.

Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a
third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no
particular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still
emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between
the second and the third case there was no interval--the one fitting
accurately within the other.

Removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself.
We had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or
bandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,
made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and
painted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the
various supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different
divinities, with numerous identical human figures, intended, very
probably, as portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head
to foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic
hieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and
titles of his relations.

Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass
beads, diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities,
of the scarabaeus, etc, with the winged globe. Around the small of the
waist was a similar collar or belt.

Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,
with no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,
smooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes
(it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were
very beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat
too determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly
gilded.

Mr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the
embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping
the surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of
the powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented
gums became apparent.

We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through
which the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could
discover none. No member of the party was at that period aware that
entire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it
was customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an
incision in the side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then
laid aside for several weeks, when the operation of embalming, properly
so called, began.

As no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing
his instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past
two o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination
until the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present,
when some one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.

The application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years
old at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently
original, and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and
nine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and
conveyed thither the Egyptian.

It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some
portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity
than other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of
course, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in
contact with the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive,
and, with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each
other good night, when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the
Mummy, were there immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in
fact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed
to be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild
stare, were now so far covered by the lids, that only a small portion of
the _tunica albuginea_ remained visible.

With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately
obvious to all.

I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,
in my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for
the Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest
of the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright
fright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied.
Mr. Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr.
Silk Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he
made his way, upon all fours, under the table.

After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter
of course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now
directed against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision
over the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis,_ and
thus got at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we
now applied the fluid to the bisected nerves--when, with a movement of
exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to
bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the
limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,
which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a
catapult, through a window into the street below.

We rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the victim,
but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an
unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more
than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment
with vigor and with zeal.

It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a
profound incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor
himself, laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact
with the wire.

Morally and physically--figuratively and literally--was the effect
electric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked very
rapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime, in the
second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the fourth,
it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth, turning to
Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very capital
Egyptian, thus:

“I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at
your behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He
is a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him.
But you, Mr. Gliddon--and you, Silk--who have travelled and resided in
Egypt until one might imagine you to the manner born--you, I say who
have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I
think, as you write your mother tongue--you, whom I have always been
led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies--I really did anticipate
more gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your standing
quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to suppose by
your permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins, and my
clothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to the
point) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little
villain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”

It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech
under the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into
violent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three
things was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of
conduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am
at a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor
the other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit
of the age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and
is now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of
paradox and impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the
Mummy’s exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his
words of the terrible. However this may be, the facts are clear, and no
member of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed
to consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong.

For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,
out of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his
hands into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew
excessively red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew
up the collar of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put
his right thumb into the left corner of his mouth.

The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and
at length, with a sneer, said:

“Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or
not? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”

Mr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out
of the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted
his left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.

Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly
to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms
what we all meant.

Mr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the
deficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would
afford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of
his very excellent speech.

I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent
conversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive
Egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other
untravelled members of the company)--through the medium, I say, of
Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke
the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I
could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of
images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)
the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of
sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning.
Mr. Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian
comprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with
a bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,
standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown
forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and
the mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.
Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until
(at Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and
consented to take off his own.

It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned
chiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling
and disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any
disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the
individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint
(for it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little
matters were now explained, it might be as well to proceed with
the investigation intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his
instruments.

In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that
Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I
did not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the
apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with
the company all round.

When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in
repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel.
We sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a
square inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.

It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of
Allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering--no doubt from the cold. The
Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with
a black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue
plaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of
brocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with
no brim, patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a
pair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size
between the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one),
there was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the
person of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been
said to be dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led
him to a comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell
upon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.

The conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,
expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s
still remaining alive.

“I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time
you were dead.”

“Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than
seven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means
in his dotage when he died.”

Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of
which it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly
misjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months
since he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.

“But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age
at the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are
still a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during
which, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”

“In what?” said the Count.

“In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.

“Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made
to answer, no doubt--but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else
than the Bichloride of Mercury.”

“But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor
Ponnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt
five thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so
delightfully well.”

“Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than
probable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the
infancy of Calvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common
thing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,
and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or
should be; they accordingly embalmed me at once--I presume you are aware
of the chief principle of the embalming process?”

“Why not altogether.”

“Why, I perceive--a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot
enter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to
embalm (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the
animal functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in
its widest sense, as including the physical not more than the moral
and vital being. I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment
consisted, with us, in the immediately arresting, and holding in
perpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected to the process.
To be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period of
embalmment, in that condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune
to be of the blood of the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see
me at present.”

“The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.

“Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very
distinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the
Scarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus
is the insignium. I speak figuratively.”

“But what has this to do with you being alive?”

“Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before
embalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone
did not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore,
I should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is
inconvenient to live.”

“I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the
entire mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”

“Beyond doubt.”

“I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one
of the Egyptian gods.”

“One of the Egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its feet.

“Gods!” repeated the traveller.

“Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,”
 said the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the
earth has ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis,
etc., were with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the
symbols, or media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too
august to be more directly approached.”

There was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor
Ponnonner.

“It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he,
“that among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of
the Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”

“There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei
embalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those
purposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and
still remain in the tomb.”

“Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by
‘purposely so embalmed’?”

“With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely
through his eye-glass--for it was the first time I had ventured to
address him a direct question.

“With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in
my time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most
extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer
than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural
term. After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already
described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable
curiosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of
science much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In
the case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of
this kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained
the age of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then
get himself carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors
pro tem., that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of
a certain period--say five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at
the expiration of this time, he would invariably find his great work
converted into a species of hap-hazard note-book--that is to say, into
a kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and
personal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators.
These guesses, etc., which passed under the name of annotations, or
emendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and
overwhelmed the text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to
discover his own book. When discovered, it was never worth the trouble
of the search. After re-writing it throughout, it was regarded as the
bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately
in correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the
traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally
lived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,
pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of
preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”

“I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his
hand gently upon the arm of the Egyptian--“I beg your pardon, sir, but
may I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”

“By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.

“I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned
the historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own
epoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were
usually found to be right?”

“The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered
to be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written
histories themselves;--that is to say, not one individual iota of either
was ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and radically
wrong.”

“But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five
thousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for
granted that your histories at that period, if not your traditions
were sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the
Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten
centuries before.”

“Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.

The Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional
explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The
latter at length said, hesitatingly:

“The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel.
During my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy
as that the universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had
a beginning at all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something
remotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin
_of the human race;_ and by this individual, the very word _Adam_
(or Red Earth), which you make use of, was employed. He employed
it, however, in a generical sense, with reference to the spontaneous
germination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of
creatures are germinated)--the spontaneous germination, I say, of five
vast hordes of men, simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and
nearly equal divisions of the globe.”

Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or
two of us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk
Buckingham, first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the
sinciput of Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:

“The long duration of human life in your time, together with
the occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in
installments, must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general
development and conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that
we are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in
all particulars of science, when compared with the moderns, and more
especially with the Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the
Egyptian skull.”

“I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am
somewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of
science do you allude?”

Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the
assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.

Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few
anecdotes, which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and
Spurzheim had flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been
nearly forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very
contemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles
of the Theban savans, who created lice and a great many other similar
things.

I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He
smiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.

This put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard
to his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had
never as yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information
on this head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well
as one Plutarch de facie lunae.

I then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in
general, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my
queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,
and begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As
for the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns
possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the
style of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer
this question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very
extraordinary way.

“Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of
both the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.

“Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New
York! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the
Capitol at Washington, D. C.!”--and the good little medical man went
on to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he
referred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less
than four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.

The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just
at that moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal
buildings of the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night
of Time, but the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of
his entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He
recollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to
an inferior palace in a kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a
hundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and
twenty-five feet apart. The approach to this portico, from the Nile,
was through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and
obelisks, twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself
(as well as he could remember) was, in one direction, two miles long,
and might have been altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were
richly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics. He
would not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s
Capitols might have been built within these walls, but he was by
no means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have
been squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at Carnac was an
insignificant little building after all. He (the Count), however, could
not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and
superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as described by the
Doctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been seen in
Egypt or elsewhere.

I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.

“Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather
ill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of
course, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which
the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred
and fifty feet in altitude.

I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.

He agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should
have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the
little palace at Carnac.

This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea
of Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon
winked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been
recently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the
Great Oasis.

I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and
asked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on
the obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.

This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the
attack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,”
 and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very
clear, but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.

The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in
his day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but
it never progressed.

We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and
were at much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the
advantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and
no king.

He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little
amused. When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had
occurred something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces
determined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to
the rest of mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the
most ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they
managed remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious.
The thing ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states,
with some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable
despotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.

I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.

As well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.

Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the
Egyptian ignorance of steam.

The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The
silent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his
elbows--told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once--and demanded
if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steam-engine
is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de Caus.

We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck
would have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,
and inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the
moderns in the all--important particular of dress.

The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons,
and then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up
close to his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth
extended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember
that he said any thing in the way of reply.

Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy
with great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as
a gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the
manufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.

We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer--but in vain. It was
not forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was
triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a
grace. Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s
mortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.

Upon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately
to bed. It is now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these
memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind. The former I
shall behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am heartily
sick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am
convinced that every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to
know who will be President in 2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and
swallow a cup of coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get
embalmed for a couple of hundred years.




THE POETIC PRINCIPLE

IN speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either
thorough or profound. While discussing, very much at random, the
essentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to
cite for consideration, some few of those minor English or American
poems which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have
left the most definite impression. By “minor poems” I mean, of course,
poems of little length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say
a few words in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether
rightfully or wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own
critical estimate of the poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I
maintain that the phrase, “a long poem,” is simply a flat contradiction
in terms.

I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as
it excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio
of this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal
necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle
a poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a
composition of any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the
very utmost, it flags--fails--a revulsion ensues--and then the poem is,
in effect, and in fact, no longer such.

There are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling
the critical dictum that the “Paradise Lost” is to be devoutly admired
throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it,
during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum
would demand. This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical,
only when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art,
Unity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve
its Unity--its totality of effect or impression--we read it (as would be
necessary) at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation
of excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be
true poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no
critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing
the work, we read it again, omitting the first book--that is to say,
commencing with the second--we shall be surprised at now finding
that admirable which we before condemned--that damnable which we had
previously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate,
aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a
nullity:--and this is precisely the fact.

In regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very
good reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but,
granting the epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an
imperfect sense of art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious ancient
model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day of
these artistic anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem
_were _popular in reality, which I doubt, it is at least clear that no
very long poem will ever be popular again.

That the extent of a poetical work is, _ceteris paribus, _the measure
of its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition
sufficiently absurd--yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly
Reviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere _size, _abstractly
considered--there can be nothing in mere _bulk, so _far as a volume
is concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these
saturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of
physical magnitude which it conveys, _does _impress us with a sense
of the sublime--but no man is impressed after _this _fashion by the
material grandeur of even “The Columbiad.” Even the Quarterlies have
not instructed us to be so impressed by it. As _yet, _they have not
_insisted _on our estimating “Lamar” tine by the cubic foot, or Pollock
by the pound--but what else are we to _infer _from their continual
plating about “sustained effort”? If, by “sustained effort,” any little
gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the
effort--if this indeed be a thing conk mendable--but let us forbear
praising the epic on the effort’s account. It is to be hoped that common
sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art
rather by the impression it makes--by the effect it produces--than by
the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of “sustained
effort” which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The
fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another--nor
can all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this
proposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received
as self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as
falsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths.

On the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief.
Undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A very short poem,
while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a
profound or enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down
of the stamp upon the wax. De Beranger has wrought innumerable
things, pungent and spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too
imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and
thus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be
whistled down the wind.

A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing
a poem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the
following exquisite little Serenade--

     I arise from dreams of thee
         In the first sweet sleep of night,
     When the winds are breathing low,
         And the stars are shining bright.
     I arise from dreams of thee,
         And a spirit in my feet
     Has led me--who knows how?--
         To thy chamber-window, sweet!

     The wandering airs they faint
         On the dark the silent stream--
     The champak odors fail
         Like sweet thoughts in a dream;
     The nightingale’s complaint,
         It dies upon her heart,
     As I must die on shine,
         O, beloved as thou art!

     O, lift me from the grass!
         I die, I faint, I fail!
     Let thy love in kisses rain
         On my lips and eyelids pale.
     My cheek is cold and white, alas!
         My heart beats loud and fast:
     O, press it close to shine again,
         Where it will break at last.

Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines--yet no less a poet
than Shelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal
imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by
him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in
the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.

One of the finest poems by Willis--the very best in my opinion which
he has ever written--has no doubt, through this same defect of undue
brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the

     The shadows lay along Broadway,
         ‘Twas near the twilight-tide--
     And slowly there a lady fair
         Was walking in her pride.
     Alone walk’d she; but, viewlessly,
         Walk’d spirits at her side.

     Peace charm’d the street beneath her feet,
         And Honor charm’d the air;
     And all astir looked kind on her,
         And called her good as fair--
     For all God ever gave to her
         She kept with chary care.

     She kept with care her beauties rare
         From lovers warm and true--
     For heart was cold to all but gold,
         And the rich came not to won,
     But honor’d well her charms to sell.
         If priests the selling do.

     Now walking there was one more fair--
         A slight girl, lily-pale;
     And she had unseen company
         To make the spirit quail--
     ‘Twixt Want and Scorn she walk’d forlorn,
         And nothing could avail.

     No mercy now can clear her brow
         From this world’s peace to pray
     For as love’s wild prayer dissolved in air,
         Her woman’s heart gave way!--
     But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven
         By man is cursed alway!

In this composition we find it difficult to recognize the Willis who has
written so many mere “verses of society.” The lines are not only richly
ideal, but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident
sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the
other works of this author.

While the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity
is indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of
the public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded
by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which,
in the brief period it has already endured, may be said to have
accomplished more in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all
its other enemies combined. I allude to the heresy of _The Didactic. _It
has been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that
the ultimate object of all Poetry is Truth. Every poem, it is said,
should inculcate a morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the
work to be adjudged. We Americans especially have patronized this happy
idea, and we Bostonians very especially have developed it in full. We
have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem’s
sake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to
confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and
force:--but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to
look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under
the sun there neither exists nor _can _exist any work more thoroughly
dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem _per se,
_this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written solely
for the poem’s sake.

With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man,
I would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation.
I would limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation.
The demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles.
All _that _which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all _that
_with which _she _has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a
flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a
truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be
simple, precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a
word, we must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the
exact converse of the poetical. _He _must be blind indeed who does not
perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the
poetical modes of inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption
who, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to
reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.

Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious
distinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I
place Taste in the middle, because it is just this position which in the
mind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme;
but from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that
Aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the
virtues themselves. Nevertheless we find the _offices _of the trio
marked with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns
itself with Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral
Sense is regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches
the obligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with
displaying the charms:--waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of
her deformity--her disproportion--her animosity to the fitting, to the
appropriate, to the harmonious--in a word, to Beauty.

An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a
sense of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in
the manifold forms, and sounds, and odors and sentiments amid which he
exists. And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of
Amaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition
of these forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a
duplicate source of the light. But this mere repetition is not poetry.
He who shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with
however vivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and
odors, and colors, and sentiments which greet _him _in common with all
mankind--he, I say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is
still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We
have still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the
crystal springs. This thirst belongs to the immortality of Man. It is at
once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence. It is
the desire of the moth for the star. It is no mere appreciation of the
Beauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired
by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle
by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time
to attain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhaps
appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by Poetry, or when by Music,
the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into
tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina supposes, through excess
of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our
inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at once and for ever,
those divine and rapturous joys of which _through’ _the poem, or
_through _the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses.

The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness--this struggle, on the
part of souls fittingly constituted--has given to the world all _that
_which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to understand and
_to feel _as poetic.

The Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes--in
Painting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance--very especially
in Music--and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the com
position of the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has regard
only to its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly on the
topic of rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music, in
its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment
in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected--is so vitally important an
adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not
now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps
that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired
by the Poetic Sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal Beauty.
It _may _be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and then,
attained in _fact. _We are often made to feel, with a shivering delight,
that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which _cannot _have been
unfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in
the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the
widest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers
had advantages which we do not possess--and Thomas Moore, singing his
own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.

To recapitulate then:--I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as
_The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty. _Its sole arbiter is Taste. With
the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations.
Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with Duty or with
Truth.

A few words, however, in explanation. _That _pleasure which is at once
the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, I
maintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation
of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable
elevation, or excitement _of the soul, _which we recognize as the Poetic
Sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the
satisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of
the heart. I make Beauty, therefore--using the word as inclusive of the
sublime--I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an
obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as directly
as possible from their causes:--no one as yet having been weak enough to
deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least _most readily
_attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that the
incitements of Passion’ or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons of
Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they
may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of
the work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in
proper subjection to that _Beauty _which is the atmosphere and the real
essence of the poem.

I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for
your consideration, than by the citation of the Proem to Longfellow’s
“Waif”:--

     The day is done, and the darkness
         Falls from the wings of Night,
     As a feather is wafted downward
         From an Eagle in his flight.

     I see the lights of the village
         Gleam through the rain and the mist,
     And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me,
         That my soul cannot resist;

     A feeling of sadness and longing,
         That is not akin to pain,
     And resembles sorrow only
         As the mist resembles the rain.

     Come, read to me some poem,
         Some simple and heartfelt lay,
     That shall soothe this restless feeling,
         And banish the thoughts of day.

     Not from the grand old masters,
         Not from the bards sublime,
     Whose distant footsteps echo
         Through the corridors of Time.

     For, like strains of martial music,
         Their mighty thoughts suggest
     Life’s endless toil and endeavor;
         And to-night I long for rest.

     Read from some humbler poet,
         Whose songs gushed from his heart,
     As showers from the clouds of summer,
         Or tears from the eyelids start;

     Who through long days of labor,
         And nights devoid of ease,
     Still heard in his soul the music
         Of wonderful melodies.

     Such songs have power to quiet
         The restless pulse of care,
     And come like the benediction
         That follows after prayer.

     Then read from the treasured volume
         The poem of thy choice,
     And lend to the rhyme of the poet
         The beauty of thy voice.

     And the night shall be filled with music,
         And the cares that infest the day
     Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,
         And as silently steal away.

With no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired
for their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective.
Nothing can be better than--

    ---------------the bards sublime,
         Whose distant footsteps echo
     Down the corridors of Time.

The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the
whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful _insouciance
_of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the
sentiments, and especially for the _ease _of the general manner. This
“ease” or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion
to regard as ease in appearance alone--as a point of really difficult
attainment. But not so:--a natural manner is difficult only to him who
should never meddle with it--to the unnatural. It is but the result of
writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that _the tone,
_in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would
adopt--and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion. The
author who, after the fashion of “The North American Review,” should
be upon _all _occasions merely “quiet,” must necessarily upon _many
_occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be
considered “easy” or “natural” than a Cockney exquisite, or than the
sleeping Beauty in the waxworks.

Among the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the
one which he entitles “June.” I quote only a portion of it:--

     There, through the long, long summer hours,
         The golden light should lie,
     And thick young herbs and groups of flowers
         Stand in their beauty by.
     The oriole should build and tell
     His love-tale, close beside my cell;
         The idle butterfly
     Should rest him there, and there be heard
     The housewife-bee and humming bird.

     And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,
         Come, from the village sent,
     Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,
         With fairy laughter blent?
     And what if, in the evening light,
     Betrothed lovers walk in sight
         Of my low monument?
     I would the lovely scene around
     Might know no sadder sight nor sound.

     I know, I know I should not see
         The season’s glorious show,
     Nor would its brightness shine for me;
         Nor its wild music flow;
     But if, around my place of sleep,
     The friends I love should come to weep,
         They might not haste to go.
     Soft airs and song, and the light and bloom,
     Should keep them lingering by my tomb.

     These to their soften’d hearts should bear
         The thoughts of what has been,
     And speak of one who cannot share
         The gladness of the scene;
     Whose part in all the pomp that fills
     The circuit of the summer hills,
         Is--that his grave is green;
     And deeply would their hearts rejoice
     To hear again his living voice.

The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous--nothing could be more
melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The
intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of
all the poet’s cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to
the soul--while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill.
The impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the
remaining compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or
less of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or
why we know not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected
with all the higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,

     A feeling of sadness and longing
         That is not akin to pain,
     And resembles sorrow only
         As the mist resembles the rain.

The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full
of brilliancy and spirit as “The Health” of Edward Coate Pinckney:--

     I fill this cup to one made up
         Of loveliness alone,
     A woman, of her gentle sex
         The seeming paragon;
     To whom the better elements
         And kindly stars have given
     A form so fair that, like the air,
         ‘Tis less of earth than heaven.

     Her every tone is music’s own,
         Like those of morning birds,
     And something more than melody
         Dwells ever in her words;
     The coinage of her heart are they,
         And from her lips each flows
     As one may see the burden’d bee
         Forth issue from the rose.

     Affections are as thoughts to her,
         The measures of her hours;
     Her feelings have the flagrancy,
         The freshness of young flowers;
     And lovely passions, changing oft,
         So fill her, she appears
     The image of themselves by turns,--
         The idol of past years!

     Of her bright face one glance will trace
         A picture on the brain,
     And of her voice in echoing hearts
         A sound must long remain;
     But memory, such as mine of her,
         So very much endears,
     When death is nigh my latest sigh
         Will not be life’s, but hers.

     I fill’d this cup to one made up
         Of loveliness alone,
     A woman, of her gentle sex
         The seeming paragon--
     Her health! and would on earth there stood,
         Some more of such a frame,
     That life might be all poetry,
         And weariness a name.

It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinckney to have been born too far south.
Had he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been
ranked as the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which
has so long controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting
the thing called “The North American Review.” The poem just cited is
especially beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must
refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet’s enthusiasm. We pardon his
hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered.

It was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the _merits
_of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for themselves.
Boccalini, in his “Advertisements from Parnassus,” tells us that Zoilus
once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable
book:--whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work. He
replied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing this,
Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out _all
the chaff _for his reward.

Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics--but I am by no
means sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that
the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood.
Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an
axiom, which need only be properly _put, _to become self-evident. It is
_not _excellence if it require to be demonstrated as such:--and thus to
point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to admit that
they are _not _merits altogether.

Among the “Melodies” of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished
character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of
view. I allude to his lines beginning--“Come, rest in this bosom.”
 The intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in
Byron. There are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that
embodies the _all in all _of the divine passion of Love--a sentiment
which, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate,
human hearts than any other single sentiment ever embodied in words:--

     Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer
     Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;
     Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o’ercast,
     And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.

     Oh! what was love made for, if ‘tis not the same
     Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?
     I know not, I ask not, if guilt’s in that heart,
     I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.

     Thou hast call’d me thy Angel in moments of bliss,
     And thy Angel I’ll be, ‘mid the horrors of this,--
     Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,
     And shield thee, and save thee,--or perish there too!

It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while
granting him Fancy--a distinction originating with Coleridge--than whom
no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact
is, that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other
faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very
naturally, the idea that he is fanciful _only. _But never was there a
greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet.
In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more
profoundly--more weirdly _imaginative, _in the best sense, than the
lines commencing--“I would I were by that dim lake”--which are the com.
position of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to remember them.

One of the noblest--and, speaking of Fancy--one of the most singularly
fanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His “Fair Ines” had always
for me an inexpressible charm:--

     O saw ye not fair Ines?
         She’s gone into the West,
     To dazzle when the sun is down,
         And rob the world of rest;
     She took our daylight with her,
         The smiles that we love best,
     With morning blushes on her cheek,
         And pearls upon her breast.

     O turn again, fair Ines,
         Before the fall of night,
     For fear the moon should shine alone,
         And stars unrivalltd bright;
     And blessed will the lover be
         That walks beneath their light,
     And breathes the love against thy cheek
         I dare not even write!

     Would I had been, fair Ines,
         That gallant cavalier,
     Who rode so gaily by thy side,
         And whisper’d thee so near!
     Were there no bonny dames at home
         Or no true lovers here,
     That he should cross the seas to win
         The dearest of the dear?

     I saw thee, lovely Ines,
         Descend along the shore,
     With bands of noble gentlemen,
         And banners waved before;
     And gentle youth and maidens gay,
         And snowy plumes they wore;
     It would have been a beauteous dream,
         If it had been no more!

     Alas, alas, fair Ines,
         She went away with song,
     With music waiting on her steps,
         And shootings of the throng;
     But some were sad and felt no mirth,
         But only Music’s wrong,
     In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,
         To her you’ve loved so long.

     Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,
         That vessel never bore
     So fair a lady on its deck,
         Nor danced so light before,--
     Alas for pleasure on the sea,
         And sorrow on the shorel
     The smile that blest one lover’s heart
         Has broken many more!

“The Haunted House,” by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever
written,--one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of the
most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It
is, moreover, powerfully ideal--imaginative. I regret that its length
renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of it
permit me to offer the universally appreciated “Bridge of Sighs”:--

     One more Unfortunate,
     Weary of breath,
     Rashly importunate
     Gone to her death!

     Take her up tenderly,
     Lift her with care;--
     Fashion’d so slenderly,
     Young and so fair!

     Look at her garments
     Clinging like cerements;
     Whilst the wave constantly
     Drips from her clothing;
     Take her up instantly,
     Loving not loathing.

     Touch her not scornfully;
     Think of her mournfully,
     Gently and humanly;
     Not of the stains of her,
     All that remains of her
     Now is pure womanly.

     Make no deep scrutiny
     Into her mutiny
     Rash and undutiful;
     Past all dishonor,
     Death has left on her
     Only the beautiful.

     Where the lamps quiver
     So far in the river,
     With many a light
     From window and casement
     From garret to basement,
     She stood, with amazement,
     Houseless by night.

     The bleak wind of March
     Made her tremble and shiver,
     But not the dark arch,
     Or the black flowing river:
     Mad from life’s history,
     Glad to death’s mystery,
     Swift to be hurl’d--
     Anywhere, anywhere
     Out of the world!

     In she plunged boldly,
     No matter how coldly
     The rough river ran,--
     Over the brink of it,
     Picture it,--think of it,
     Dissolute Man!
     Lave in it, drink of it
     Then, if you can!

     Still, for all slips of hers,
     One of Eve’s family--
     Wipe those poor lips of hers
     Oozing so clammily,
     Loop up her tresses
     Escaped from the comb,
     Her fair auburn tresses;
     Whilst wonderment guesses
     Where was her home?

     Who was her father?
     Who was her mother?
     Had she a sister?
     Had she a brother?
     Or was there a dearer one
     Still, and a nearer one
     Yet, than all other?

     Alas! for the rarity
     Of Christian charity
     Under the sun!
     Oh! it was pitiful!
     Near a whole city full,
     Home she had none.

     Sisterly, brotherly,
     Fatherly, motherly,
     Feelings had changed:
     Love, by harsh evidence,
     Thrown from its eminence;
     Even God’s providence
     Seeming estranged.

     Take her up tenderly;
     Lift her with care;
     Fashion’d so slenderly,
     Young, and so fair!
     Ere her limbs frigidly
     Stiffen too rigidly,
     Decently,--kindly,--
     Smooth and compose them;
     And her eyes, close them,
     Staring so blindly!

     Dreadfully staring
     Through muddy impurity,
     As when with the daring
     Last look of despairing
     Fixed on futurity.

     Perhishing gloomily,
     Spurred by contumely,
     Cold inhumanity,
     Burning insanity,
     Into her rest,--
     Cross her hands humbly,
     As if praying dumbly,
     Over her breast!
     Owning her weakness,
     Her evil behavior,
     And leaving, with meekness,
     Her sins to her Saviour!

The vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The
versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the
fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which
is the thesis of the poem.

Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from
the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:--

     Though the day of my destiny’s over,
         And the star of my fate bath declined
     Thy soft heart refused to discover
         The faults which so many could find;
     Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,
         It shrunk not to share it with me,
     And the love which my spirit bath painted
         It never bath found but in _thee._

     Then when nature around me is smiling,
         The last smile which answers to mine,
     I do not believe it beguiling,
         Because it reminds me of shine;
     And when winds are at war with the ocean,
         As the breasts I believed in with me,
     If their billows excite an emotion,
         It is that they bear me from _thee._

     Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,
         And its fragments are sunk in the wave,
     Though I feel that my soul is delivered
         To pain--it shall not be its slave.
     There is many a pang to pursue me:
         They may crush, but they shall not contemn--
     They may torture, but shall not subdue me--
         ‘Tis of _thee _that I think--not of them.

     Though human, thou didst not deceive me,
         Though woman, thou didst not forsake,
     Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,
         Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,--
     Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,
         Though parted, it was not to fly,
     Though watchful, ‘twas not to defame me,
         Nor mute, that the world might belie.

     Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,
         Nor the war of the many with one--
     If my soul was not fitted to prize it,
         ‘Twas folly not sooner to shun:
     And if dearly that error bath cost me,
         And more than I once could foresee,
     I have found that whatever it lost me,
         It could not deprive me of _thee._

     From the wreck of the past, which bath perished,
         Thus much I at least may recall,
     It bath taught me that which I most cherished
         Deserved to be dearest of all:
     In the desert a fountain is springing,
         In the wide waste there still is a tree,
     And a bird in the solitude singing,
        Which speaks to my spirit of _thee._

Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification
could scarcely be improved. No nobler _theme _ever engaged the pen of
poet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself
entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the
unwavering love of woman.

From Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the
noblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a
very brief specimen. I call him, and _think _him the noblest of poets,
_not _because the impressions he produces are at _all _times the most
profound--_not _because the poetical excitement which he induces is at
_all _times the most intense--but because it is at all times the most
ethereal--in other words, the most elevating and most pure. No poet is
so little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read is from his last
long poem, “The Princess”:--

         Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,
     Tears from the depth of some divine despair
     Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
     In looking on the happy Autumn fields,
     And thinking of the days that are no more.

         Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
     That brings our friends up from the underworld,
     Sad as the last which reddens over one
     That sinks with all we love below the verge;
     So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.

         Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
     The earliest pipe of half-awaken’d birds
     To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
     The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
     So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.

         Dear as remember’d kisses after death,
     And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign’d
     On lips that are for others; deep as love,
     Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
     O Death in Life, the days that are no more.

Thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored
to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my
purpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and
simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of
the Principle is always found in _an elevating excitement of the soul,
_quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the
Heart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For
in regard to passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to
elevate the Soul. Love, on the contrary--Love--the true, the divine
Eros--the Uranian as distinguished from the Diona an Venus--is
unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in
regard to Truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth
we are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before,
we experience at once the true poetical effect; but this effect is
referable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth
which merely served to render the harmony manifest.

We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what
the true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements
which induce in the Poet himself the poetical effect He recognizes
the ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine
in Heaven--in the volutes of the flower--in the clustering of low
shrubberies--in the waving of the grain-fields--in the slanting of tall
eastern trees--in the blue distance of mountains--in the grouping of
clouds--in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks--in the gleaming of
silver rivers--in the repose of sequestered lakes--in the star-mirroring
depths of lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds--in the
harp of Bolos--in the sighing of the night-wind--in the repining voice
of the forest--in the surf that complains to the shore--in the fresh
breath of the woods--in the scent of the violet--in the voluptuous
perfume of the hyacinth--in the suggestive odour that comes to him
at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans,
illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts--in all
unworldly motives--in all holy impulses--in all chivalrous, generous,
and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman--in
the grace of her step--in the lustre of her eye--in the melody of her
voice--in her soft laughter, in her sigh--in the harmony of the rustling
of her robes. He deeply feels it in her winning endearments--in her
burning enthusiasms--in her gentle charities--in her meek and devotional
endurances--but above all--ah, far above all, he kneels to it--he
worships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the
altogether divine majesty--of her love.

Let me conclude by--the recitation of yet another brief poem--one very
different in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by
Motherwell, and is called “The Song of the Cavalier.” With our modern
and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare,
we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize
with the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the
poem. To do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul
of the old cavalier:--

     Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,
         And don your helmes amaine:
     Deathe’s couriers. Fame and Honor call
         No shrewish teares shall fill your eye
     When the sword-hilt’s in our hand,--
         Heart-whole we’ll part, and no whit sighe
     For the fayrest of the land;
         Let piping swaine, and craven wight,
     Thus weepe and poling crye,
         Our business is like men to fight.




OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*)

IT should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with
which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be-attributed to
what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry-we mean to the simple
love of the antique-and that, again, a third of even the proper _poetic
sentiment _inspired_ _by their writings should be ascribed to a fact
which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and
with the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as
a merit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout
admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,
would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,
wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on
being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure,
he would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general
handling. This quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to
ideality, but in the case in question it arises independently of the
author’s will, and is altogether apart from his intention. Words and
their rhythm have varied. Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid
delight, and which delight, in many instances, may be traced to the one
source, quaintness, must have worn in the days of their construction, a
very commonplace air. This is, of course, no argument against the poems
now-we mean it only as against the poets _thew. _There is a growing
desire to overrate them. The old English muse was frank, guileless,
sincere, and although very learned, still learned without art. No
general error evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the
error of supposing Donne and Cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein
Wordsworth and Coleridge are so. With the two former ethics were the
end-with the two latter the means. The poet of the “Creation” wished,
by highly artificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral
truth-the poet of the “Ancient Mariner” to infuse the Poetic Sentiment
through channels suggested by analysis. The one finished by complete
failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the other, by
a path which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a triumph
which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of
the multitude. But in this view even the “metaphysical verse” of Cowley
is but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the man. And
he was in this but a type of his school-for we may as well designate
in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in
the volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very
perceptible general character. They used little art in composition.
Their writings sprang immediately from the soul-and partook intensely of
that soul’s nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this
_abandon-to elevate _immeasurably all the energies of mind-but, again,
so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all good
things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility, as to
render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind in
such a school will be found inferior to those results in one _(ceteris
_paribus) more artificial.

We can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the “Book
of Gems” are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest
possible idea of the beauty of the school-but if the intention had
been merely to show the school’s character, the attempt might have been
considered successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now
before us of the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever
beyond that of their antiquity.. The criticisms of the editor do not
particularly please us. His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not
to be false. His opinion, for example, of Sir Henry Wotton’s “Verses on
the Queen of Bohemia”--that “there are few finer things in our language,”
 is untenable and absurd.

In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of
Poesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all
time. Here every thing is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No
prepossession for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no
other prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of
poetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments,
stitched, apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and
without even an attempt at adaptation.

In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with “The
Shepherd’s Hunting” by Withers--a poem partaking, in a remarkable
degree, of the peculiarities of “Il Penseroso.” Speaking of Poesy the
author says:

     “By the murmur of a spring,
     Or the least boughs rustleling,
     By a daisy whose leaves spread,
     Shut when Titan goes to bed,
     Or a shady bush or tree,
     She could more infuse in me
     Than all Nature’s beauties can
     In some other wiser man.
     By her help I also now
     Make this churlish place allow
     Something that may sweeten gladness
     In the very gall of sadness--
     The dull loneness, the black shade,
     That these hanging vaults have made
     The strange music of the waves
     Beating on these hollow caves,
     This black den which rocks emboss,
     Overgrown with eldest moss,
     The rude portals that give light
     More to terror than delight,
     This my chamber of neglect

     Walled about with disrespect;
     From all these and this dull air
     A fit object for despair,
     She hath taught me by her might
     To draw comfort and delight.”

But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general
character of the English antique. Something more of this will be found
in Corbet’s “Farewell to the Fairies!” We copy a portion of Marvell’s
“Maiden lamenting for her Fawn,” which we prefer-not only as a specimen
of the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in
pathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness-to anything of
its species:

     “It is a wondrous thing how fleet
     ‘Twas on those little silver feet,
     With what a pretty skipping grace
     It oft would challenge me the race,
     And when’t had left me far away
     ‘Twould stay, and run again, and stay;
     For it was nimbler much than hinds,
     And trod as if on the four winds.
     I have a garden of my own,
     But so with roses overgrown,
     And lilies, that you would it guess
     To be a little wilderness;
     And all the spring-time of the year
     It only loved to be there.
     Among the beds of lilies I
     Have sought it oft where it should lie,
     Yet could not, till itself would rise,
     Find it, although before mine eyes.
     For in the flaxen lilies’ shade
     It like a bank of lilies laid;
     Upon the roses it would feed
     Until its lips even seemed to bleed,
     And then to me ‘twould boldly trip,
     And print those roses on my lip,
     But all its chief delight was still
     With roses thus itself to fill,
     And its pure virgin limbs to fold
     In whitest sheets of lilies cold.
     Had it lived long, it would have been
     Lilies without, roses within.”

How truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable!
It pervades all.. It comes over the sweet melody of the words-over the
gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself-even
over the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the
beauties and good qualities of her favorite-like the cool shadow of a
summer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets, “and all sweet flowers.”
 The whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is
an idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the
artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her
grief, or the fragrance and warmth and _appropriateness _of the little
nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon
them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy
little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on
her face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought
in the few lines we have quoted the _wonder _of the little maiden at the
fleetness of her favorite-the “little silver feet”--the fawn challenging
his mistress to a race with “a pretty skipping grace,” running on
before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her approach only to
fly from it again-can we not distinctly perceive all these things? How
exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,

“And trod as if on the four winds!”

A vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of
the speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then
consider the garden of “my own,” so overgrown, entangled with roses and
lilies, as to be “a little wilderness”--the fawn loving to be there,
and there “only”--the maiden seeking it “where it _should _lie”--and
not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until “itself would
rise”--the lying among the lilies “like a bank of lilies”--the loving to
“fill itself with roses,”

        “And its pure virgin limbs to fold
        In whitest sheets of lilies cold,”

and these things being its “chief” delights-and then the pre-eminent
beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole
only renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence,
the artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more
passionate admiration of the bereaved child--

“Had it lived long, it would have been Lilies without, roses within.”

PREFACE

THESE trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their
redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected
while going at random the “rounds of the press.” I am naturally anxious
that what I have written should circulate as I wrote it, if it circulate
at all. In defence of my own taste, nevertheless, it is incumbent upon
me to say that I think nothing in this volume of much value to the
public, or very creditable to myself. Events not to be controlled have
prevented me from making, at any time, any serious effort in what, under
happier circumstances, would have been the field of my choice. With me
poetry has been not a purpose, but a passion; and the passions should be
held in reverence: they must not-they can not at will be excited, with
an eye to the paltry compensations, or the more paltry commendations, of
man-kind.

POEMS OF LATER LIFE




THE RAVEN.

 Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
 Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
 While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
 As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
 “‘Tis some visiter,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door--
                          Only this, and nothing more.”

 Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
 And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
 Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow
 From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--
 For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
                          Nameless here for evermore.

 And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
 Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
 So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
 “‘Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door--
 Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;--
                          This it is, and nothing more.”

 Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
 “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
 But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
 And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
 That I scarce was sure I heard you “--here I opened wide the door;----
                          Darkness there and nothing more.

 Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
 But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
 And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”
  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”--
                          Merely this, and nothing more.

 Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
 Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.
 “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
 Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--
 Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--
                          ‘Tis the wind and nothing more!”

 Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
 In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
 Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;
 But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--
 Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--
                          Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

 Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
 By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
 “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
 Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore--
 Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
                          Quoth the raven “Nevermore.”

 Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
 Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
 For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
 Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--
 Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
                         With such name as “Nevermore.”

 But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
 That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
 Nothing farther then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
 Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before--
 On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”
                          Then the bird said “Nevermore.”

 Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
 “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store
 Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
 Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--
 Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
                         Of “Never--nevermore.”

 But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
 Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
 Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
 Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
 What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
                         Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”

 This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
 To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;
 This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
 On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplght gloated o’er,
 But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er,
                          _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!

 Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
 Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
 “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent
 thee
 Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
 Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”

 “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--
 Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
 Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--
 On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--
 Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!”
                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”

 “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!
 By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--
 Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
 It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
 Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”

 “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting--
 “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
 Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
 Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!
 Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
                          Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”

 And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
 On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
 And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,
 And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
 And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
                          Shall be lifted--nevermore!

THE BELLS.

                                       I.

                    HEAR the sledges with the bells--
                          Silver bells!
     What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
                How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
                      In the icy air of night!
                While the stars that oversprinkle
                All the heavens, seem to twinkle
                      With a crystalline delight;
                   Keeping time, time, time,
                   In a sort of Runic rhyme,
     To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
           From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
                          Bells, bells, bells--
        From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

                                      II.

                    Hear the mellow wedding-bells
                          Golden bells!
     What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
                Through the balmy air of night
                How they ring out their delight!--
                      From the molten-golden notes,
                          And all in tune,
                      What a liquid ditty floats
           To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
                          On the moon!
                  Oh, from out the sounding cells,
     What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
                          How it swells!
                          How it dwells
                      On the Future!--how it tells
                      Of the rapture that impels
                  To the swinging and the ringing
                      Of the bells, bells, bells--
           Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
                          Bells, bells, bells--
        To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!

                                      III.

                    Hear the loud alarum bells--
                          Brazen bells!
     What tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!
                In the startled ear of night
                How they scream out their affright!
                    Too much horrified to speak,
                    They can only shriek, shriek,
                       Out of tune,
     In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
     In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,
                       Leaping higher, higher, higher,
                       With a desperate desire,
                    And a resolute endeavor
                    Now--now to sit, or never,
                By the side of the pale-faced moon.
                       Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
                       What a tale their terror tells
                          Of Despair!
             How they clang, and clash, and roar!
             What a horror they outpour
     On the bosom of the palpitating air!
                Yet the ear, it fully knows,
                      By the twanging
                      And the clanging,
                 How the danger ebbs and flows;
             Yet, the ear distinctly tells,
                   In the jangling
                   And the wrangling,
             How the danger sinks and swells,
     By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells--
                   Of the bells--
           Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
                          Bells, bells, bells--
        In the clamour and the clangour of the bells!

                                   IV.

                    Hear the tolling of the bells--
                          Iron bells!
     What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
             In the silence of the night,
             How we shiver with affright
         At the melancholy meaning of their tone!
                 For every sound that floats
                 From the rust within their throats
                         Is a groan.
                     And the people--ah, the people--
                     They that dwell up in the steeple,
                         All alone,
                 And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,
                     In that muffled monotone,
                 Feel a glory in so rolling
                     On the human heart a stone--
             They are neither man nor woman--
             They are neither brute nor human--
                         They are Ghouls:--
                 And their king it is who tolls:--
                 And he rolls, rolls, rolls, rolls,
                          Rolls
                     A pæan from the bells!
                 And his merry bosom swells
                     With the pæan of the bells!
                 And he dances, and he yells;
             Keeping time, time, time,
             In a sort of Runic rhyme,
                     To the pæan of the bells--
                          Of the bells:--
             Keeping time, time, time,
             In a sort of Runic rhyme,
                     To the throbbing of the bells--
                 Of the bells, bells, bells--
                     To the sobbing of the bells:--
             Keeping time, time, time,
                 As he knells, knells, knells,
             In a happy Runic rhyme,
                     To the rolling of the bells--
                 Of the bells, bells, bells:--
                     To the tolling of the bells--
           Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
                          Bells, bells, bells--
        To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.

ULALUME

     The skies they were ashen and sober;
         The leaves they were crisped and sere--
         The leaves they were withering and sere;
     It was night in the lonesome October
         Of my most immemorial year:
     It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
         In the misty mid region of Weir:--
     It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
         In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

     Here once, through an alley Titanic,
         Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--
         Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
     There were days when my heart was volcanic
         As the scoriac rivers that roll--
         As the lavas that restlessly roll
     Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek,
         In the ultimate climes of the Pole--
     That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
         In the realms of the Boreal Pole.

     Our talk had been serious and sober,
         But our thoughts they were palsied and sere--
         Our memories were treacherous and sere;
     For we knew not the month was October,
         And we marked not the night of the year--
         (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
     We noted not the dim lake of Auber,
         (Though once we had journeyed down here)
     We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
         Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

     And now, as the night was senescent,
         And star-dials pointed to morn--
         As the star-dials hinted of morn--
     At the end of our path a liquescent
         And nebulous lustre was born,
     Out of which a miraculous crescent
         Arose with a duplicate horn--
     Astarte’s bediamonded crescent,
         Distinct with its duplicate horn.

     And I said--“She is warmer than Dian:
         She rolls through an ether of sighs--
         She revels in a region of sighs.
     She has seen that the tears are not dry on
         These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
     And has come past the stars of the Lion,
         To point us the path to the skies--
         To the Lethean peace of the skies--
     Come up, in despite of the Lion,
         To shine on us with her bright eyes--
     Come up, through the lair of the Lion,
         With love in her luminous eyes.”

     But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
         Said--“Sadly this star I mistrust--
         Her pallor I strangely mistrust--
     Ah, hasten!--ah, let us not linger!
         Ah, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.”
      In terror she spoke; letting sink her
         Wings till they trailed in the dust--
     In agony sobbed, letting sink her
         Plumes till they trailed in the dust--
         Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

     I replied--“This is nothing but dreaming.
         Let us on, by this tremulous light!
         Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
     Its Sybillic splendor is beaming
         With Hope and in Beauty to-night--
         See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!
     Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
         And be sure it will lead us aright--
     We safely may trust to a gleaming
         That cannot but guide us aright,
         Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.”

     Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
         And tempted her out of her gloom--
         And conquered her scruples and gloom;
     And we passed to the end of the vista--
         But were stopped by the door of a tomb--
         By the door of a legended tomb:--
     And I said--“What is written, sweet sister,
         On the door of this legended tomb?”
          She replied--“Ulalume--Ulalume--
         ‘T is the vault of thy lost Ulalume!”

     Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
         As the leaves that were crisped and sere--
         As the leaves that were withering and sere--
     And I cried--“It was surely October
         On _this_ very night of last year,
         That I journeyed--I journeyed down here!--
         That I brought a dread burden down here--
         On this night, of all nights in the year,
         Ah, what demon has tempted me here?
     Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--
         This misty mid region of Weir:--
     Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber--
         This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.”

1847.




TO HELEN

     I saw thee once--once only--years ago:
     I must not say how many--but not many.
     It was a July midnight; and from out
     A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
     Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
     There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,
     With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,
     Upon the upturned faces of a thousand
     Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,
     Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--
     Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses
     That gave out, in return for the love-light,
     Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death--
     Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses
     That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted
     By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.

     Clad all in white, upon a violet bank
     I saw thee half reclining; while the moon
     Fell on the upturn’d faces of the roses,
     And on thine own, upturn’d--alas, in sorrow!

     Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight-
     Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,)
     That bade me pause before that garden-gate,
     To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
     No footstep stirred: the hated world an slept,
     Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!--oh, God!
     How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)
     Save only thee and me. I paused--I looked-
     And in an instant all things disappeared.
     (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)

     The pearly lustre of the moon went out:
     The mossy banks and the meandering paths,
     The happy flowers and the repining trees,
     Were seen no more: the very roses’ odors
     Died in the arms of the adoring airs.
     All--all expired save thee--save less than thou:
     Save only the divine light in thine eyes-
     Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.
     I saw but them--they were the world to me!
     I saw but them--saw only them for hours,
     Saw only them until the moon went down.
     What wild heart-histories seemed to he enwritten

     Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!
     How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope!
     How silently serene a sea of pride!
     How daring an ambition; yet how deep-
     How fathomless a capacity for love!

     But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,
     Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;
     And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
     Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained;
     They would not go--they never yet have gone;
     Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,
     They have not left me (as my hopes have) since;
     They follow me--they lead me through the years.
     They are my ministers--yet I their slave.
     Their office is to illumine and enkindle--
     My duty, to be saved by their bright light,
     And purified in their electric fire,
     And sanctified in their elysian fire.
     They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),
     And are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to
     In the sad, silent watches of my night;
     While even in the meridian glare of day
     I see them still--two sweetly scintillant
     Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!




ANNABEL LEE.

     It was many and many a year ago,
         In a kingdom by the sea,
     That a maiden lived whom you may know
         By the name of ANNABEL LEE;--
     And this maiden she lived with no other thought
         Than to love and be loved by me.

     _I_ was a child and _She_ was a child,
         In this kingdom by the sea,
     But we loved with a love that was more than love--
         I and my ANNABEL LEE--
     With a love that the wingéd seraphs of Heaven
         Coveted her and me.

     And this was the reason that, long ago,
         In this kingdom by the sea,
     A wind blew out of a cloud by night
         Chilling my ANNABEL LEE;
     So that her high-born kinsmen came
         And bore her away from me,
     To shut her up, in a sepulchre
         In this kingdom by the sea.

     The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
         Went envying her and me;
     Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,
         In this kingdom by the sea)
     That the wind came out of the cloud, chilling
         And killing my ANNABEL LEE.

     But our love it was stronger by far than the love
         Of those who were older than we--
         Of many far wiser than we--
     And neither the angels in Heaven above
         Nor the demons down under the sea
     Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
         Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE:--

     For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
         Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
     And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
         Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
     And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
     Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride
         In her sepulchre there by the sea--
         In her tomb by the side of the sea.

1849.




A VALENTINE.

     For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,
         Brightly expressive as the twins of Loeda,
     Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies
         Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.
     Search narrowly the lines!--they hold a treasure
         Divine--a talisman--an amulet
     That must be worn _at heart_. Search well the measure--
         The words--the syllables! Do not forget
     The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor!
         And yet there is in this no Gordian knot

     Which one might not undo without a sabre,
         If one could merely comprehend the plot.
     Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
         Eyes scintillating soul, there lie _perdus_
     Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
         Of poets, by poets--as the name is a poet’s, too.
     Its letters, although naturally lying
         Like the knight Pinto--Mendez Ferdinando--
     Still form a synonym for Truth--Cease trying!
         You will not read the riddle, though you do the best _you_ can do.

AN ENIGMA

     “Seldom we find,” says Solomon Don Dunce,
         “Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
     Through all the flimsy things we see at once
         As easily as through a Naples bonnet--
         Trash of all trash!--how _can_ a lady don it?
     Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff-
     Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
         Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it.”
      And, veritably, Sol is right enough.
     The general tuckermanities are arrant
     Bubbles--ephemeral and _so_ transparent--
         But _this_ is, now,--you may depend upon it--
     Stable, opaque, immortal--all by dint
     Of the dear names that lie concealed within ‘t.



1847.


TO MY MOTHER

     Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,
         The angels, whispering to one another,
     Can find, among their burning terms of love,
         None so devotional as that of “Mother,”
      Therefore by that dear name I long have called you--
         You who are more than mother unto me,
     And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you
         In setting my Virginia’s spirit free.
     My mother--my own mother, who died early,
         Was but the mother of myself; but you
     Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,
         And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
     By that infinity with which my wife
         Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.

1849.

[The above was addressed to the poet’s mother-in-law, Mrs. Clemm--Ed.]




FOR ANNIE

     Thank Heaven! the crisis--
         The danger is past,
     And the lingering illness
         Is over at last--
     And the fever called “Living”
          Is conquered at last.

     Sadly, I know
         I am shorn of my strength,
     And no muscle I move
         As I lie at full length--
     But no matter!--I feel
         I am better at length.

     And I rest so composedly,
         Now, in my bed,
     That any beholder
         Might fancy me dead--
     Might start at beholding me,
         Thinking me dead.

     The moaning and groaning,
         The sighing and sobbing,
     Are quieted now,
         With that horrible throbbing
     At heart:--ah, that horrible,
         Horrible throbbing!

     The sickness--the nausea--
         The pitiless pain--
     Have ceased, with the fever
         That maddened my brain--
     With the fever called “Living”
          That burned in my brain.

     And oh! of all tortures
         _That_ torture the worst
     Has abated--the terrible
         Torture of thirst
     For the naphthaline river
         Of Passion accurst:--
     I have drank of a water
         That quenches all thirst:--

     Of a water that flows,
         With a lullaby sound,
     From a spring but a very few
         Feet under ground--
     From a cavern not very far
         Down under ground.

     And ah! let it never
         Be foolishly said
     That my room it is gloomy
         And narrow my bed;
     For man never slept
         In a different bed--
     And, to _sleep_, you must slumber
         In just such a bed.

     My tantalized spirit
         Here blandly reposes,
     Forgetting, or never
         Regretting its roses--
     Its old agitations
         Of myrtles and roses:

     For now, while so quietly
         Lying, it fancies
     A holier odor
         About it, of pansies--
     A rosemary odor,
         Commingled with pansies--
     With rue and the beautiful
         Puritan pansies.

     And so it lies happily,
         Bathing in many
     A dream of the truth
         And the beauty of Annie--
     Drowned in a bath
         Of the tresses of Annie.

     She tenderly kissed me,
         She fondly caressed,
     And then I fell gently
         To sleep on her breast--
     Deeply to sleep
         From the heaven of her breast.

     When the light was extinguished,
         She covered me warm,
     And she prayed to the angels
         To keep me from harm--
     To the queen of the angels
         To shield me from harm.

     And I lie so composedly,
         Now in my bed,
     (Knowing her love)
         That you fancy me dead--
     And I rest so contentedly,
         Now in my bed,
     (With her love at my breast)
         That you fancy me dead--
     That you shudder to look at me,
         Thinking me dead:--

     But my heart it is brighter
         Than all of the many
     Stars in the sky,
         For it sparkles with Annie--
     It glows with the light
         Of the love of my Annie--
     With the thought of the light
         Of the eyes of my Annie.

1849.




TO F----.

     BELOVED! amid the earnest woes
         That crowd around my earthly path--
     (Drear path, alas! where grows
     Not even one lonely rose)--
         My soul at least a solace hath
     In dreams of thee, and therein knows
     An Eden of bland repose.

     And thus thy memory is to me
         Like some enchanted far-off isle
     In some tumultuos sea--
     Some ocean throbbing far and free
         With storms--but where meanwhile
     Serenest skies continually
         Just o’re that one bright island smile.

TO FRANCES S. OSGOOD

     THOU wouldst be loved?--then let thy heart
         From its present pathway part not!
     Being everything which now thou art,
         Be nothing which thou art not.
     So with the world thy gentle ways,
         Thy grace, thy more than beauty,
     Shall be an endless theme of praise,
         And love--a simple duty.

ELDORADO.

         Gaily bedight,
         A gallant knight,
     In sunshine and in shadow,
         Had journeyed long,
         Singing a song,
     In search of Eldorado.

         But he grew old--
         This knight so bold--
     And o’er his heart a shadow
         Fell, as he found
         No spot of ground
     That looked like Eldorado.

         And, as his strength
         Failed him at length,
     He met a pilgrim shadow--
         ‘Shadow,’ said he,
         ‘Where can it be--
     This land of Eldorado?’

         ‘Over the Mountains
         Of the Moon,
     Down the Valley of the Shadow,
         Ride, boldly ride,’
         The shade replied,--
     ‘If you seek for Eldorado!’

                     EULALIE

                          I  DWELT alone
                         In a world of moan,
             And my soul was a stagnant tide,
     Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride--
     Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.

                         Ah, less--less bright
                         The stars of the night
                 Than the eyes of the radiant girl!
                         And never a flake
                         That the vapour can make
                 With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,
     Can vie with the modest Eulalie’s most unregarded curl--
     Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie’s most humble and careless curl.

                    Now Doubt--now Pain
                    Come never again,
            For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,
                    And all day long
                    Shines, bright and strong,
            Astarté within the sky,
     While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye--
     While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.

1845.




      A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM

     Take this kiss upon the brow!
     And, in parting from you now,
     Thus much let me avow--
     You are not wrong, who deem
     That my days have been a dream;
     Yet if hope has flown away
     In a night, or in a day,
     In a vision, or in none,
     Is it therefore the less _gone_?
     _All_ that we see or seem
     Is but a dream within a dream.

     I stand amid the roar
     Of a surf-tormented shore,
     And I hold within my hand
     Grains of the golden sand--
     How few! yet how they creep
     Through my fingers to the deep,
     While I weep--while I weep!
     O God! can I not grasp
     Them with a tighter clasp?
     O God! can I not save
     _One_ from the pitiless wave?
     Is _all_ that we see or seem
     But a dream within a dream?.

1849




TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)

     Of all who hail thy presence as the morning--
     Of all to whom thine absence is the night--
     The blotting utterly from out high heaven
     The sacred sun--of all who, weeping, bless thee
     Hourly for hope--for life--ah! above all,
     For the resurrection of deep-buried faith
     In Truth--in Virtue--in Humanity--
     Of all who, on Despair’s unhallowed bed
     Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
     At thy soft-murmured words, “Let there be light!”
      At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
     In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes--
     Of all who owe thee most--whose gratitude
     Nearest resembles worship--oh, remember
     The truest--the most fervently devoted,
     And think that these weak lines are written by him--
     By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
     His spirit is communing with an angel’s.

1847.




TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)

     NOT long ago, the writer of these lines,
     In the mad pride of intellectuality,
     Maintained “the power of words”--denied that ever
     A thought arose within the human brain
     Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
     And now, as if in mockery of that boast,
     Two words-two foreign soft dissyllables--
     Italian tones, made only to be murmured
     By angels dreaming in the moonlit “dew
     That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,”--
     Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
     Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
     Richer, far wider, far diviner visions
     Than even the seraph harper, Israfel,
     (Who has “the sweetest voice of all God’s creatures”)
     Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.
     The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.
     With thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee,
     I can not write-I can not speak or think--
     Alas, I can not feel; for ‘tis not feeling,
     This standing motionless upon the golden
     Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,
     Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
     And thrilling as I see, upon the right,
     Upon the left, and all the way along,
     Amid empurpled vapors, far away
     To where the prospect terminates-_thee only!_

1848.




THE CITY IN THE SEA.

     Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
     In a strange city lying alone
     Far down within the dim West,
     Wherethe good and the bad and the worst and the best
     Have gone to their eternal rest.
     There shrines and palaces and towers
     (Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)
     Resemble nothing that is ours.
     Around, by lifting winds forgot,
     Resignedly beneath the sky
     The melancholy waters lie.

     No rays from the holy heaven come down
     On the long night-time of that town;
     But light from out the lurid sea
     Streams up the turrets silently--
     Gleams up the pinnacles far and free--
     Up domes--up spires--up kingly halls--
     Up fanes--up Babylon-like walls--
     Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
     Of scultured ivy and stone flowers--
     Up many and many a marvellous shrine
     Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
     The viol, the violet, and the vine.

     Resignedly beneath the sky
     The melancholy waters lie.
     So blend the turrets and shadows there
     That all seem pendulous in air,
     While from a proud tower in the town
     Death looks gigantically down.

     There open fanes and gaping graves
     Yawn level with the luminous waves;
     But not the riches there that lie
     In each idol’s diamond eye--
     Not the gaily-jewelled dead
     Tempt the waters from their bed;
     For no ripples curl, alas!
     Along that wilderness of glass--
     No swellings tell that winds may be
     Upon some far-off happier sea--
     No heavings hint that winds have been
     On seas less hideously serene.

     But lo, a stir is in the air!
     The wave--there is a movement there!
     As if the towers had thrown aside,
     In slightly sinking, the dull tide--
     As if their tops had feebly given
     A void within the filmy Heaven.
     The waves have now a redder glow--
     The hours are breathing faint and low--
     And when, amid no earthly moans,
     Down, down that town shall settle hence,
     Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
     Shall do it reverence.

1845.




THE SLEEPER.

     At midnight in the month of June,
     I stand beneath the mystic moon.
     An opiate vapour, dewy, dim,
     Exhales from out her golden rim,
     And, softly dripping, drop by drop,
     Upon the quiet mountain top.
     Steals drowsily and musically
     Into the univeral valley.
     The rosemary nods upon the grave;
     The lily lolls upon the wave;
     Wrapping the fog about its breast,
     The ruin moulders into rest;
     Looking like Lethe, see! the lake
     A conscious slumber seems to take,
     And would not, for the world, awake.
     All Beauty sleeps!--and lo! where lies
     (Her easement open to the skies)
     Irene, with her Destinies!

     Oh, lady bright! can it be right--
     This window open to the night?
     The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
     Laughingly through the lattice drop--
     The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
     Flit through thy chamber in and out,
     And wave the curtain canopy
     So fitfully--so fearfully--
     Above the closed and fringed lid
     ‘Neath which thy slumb’ring sould lies hid,
     That o’er the floor and down the wall,
     Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
     Oh, lady dear, hast thous no fear?
     Why and what art thou dreaming here?
     Sure thou art come p’er far-off seas,
     A wonder to these garden trees!
     Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!
     Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
     And this all solemn silentness!

     The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
     Which is enduring, so be deep!
     Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
     This chamber changed for one more holy,
     This bed for one more melancholy,
     I pray to God that she may lie
     Forever with unopened eye,
     While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!

     My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
     As it is lasting, so be deep!
     Soft may the worms about her creep!
     Far in the forest, dim and old,
     For her may some tall vault unfold--
     Some vault that oft hath flung its black
     And winged pannels fluttering back,
     Triumphant, o’er the crested palls,
     Of her grand family funerals--
     Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
     Against whose portal she hath thrown,
     In childhood, many an idle stone--
     Some tomb fromout whose sounding door
     She ne’er shall force an echo more,
     Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!
     It was the dead who groaned within.

1845.




 BRIDAL BALLAD.

     THE ring is on my hand,
         And the wreath is on my brow;
     Satins and jewels grand
     Are all at my command,
         And I am happy now.

     And my lord he loves me well;
         But, when first he breathed his vow,
     I felt my bosom swell--
     For the words rang as a knell,
     And the voice seemed _his_ who fell
     In the battle down the dell,
         And who is happy now.

     But he spoke to re-asure me,
         And he kissed my pallid brow,
     While a reverie came o’re me,
     And to the church-yard bore me,
     And I sighed to him before me,
     Thinking him dead D’Elormie,
         “Oh, I am happy now!”

     And thus the words were spoken,
         And this the plighted vow,
     And, though my faith be broken,
     And, though my heart be broken,
     Behold the golden token
         That _proves_ me happy now!

     Would God I could awaken!
         For I dream I know not how,
     And my soul is sorely shaken
     Lest an evil step be taken,--
     Lest the dead who is forsaken
         May not be happy now.

1845.

NOTES

1. “The Raven” was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the New
York “Evening Mirror”--a paper its author was then assistant editor of.
It was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written
by N. P. Willis: “We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication)
from the second number of the “American Review,” the following
remarkable poem by Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective
single example of ‘fugitive poetry’ ever published in this country, and
unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity
of versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and
‘pokerishness.’ It is one of those ‘dainties bred in a book’ which we
feed on. It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.” In the
February number of the “American Review” the poem was published as
by “Quarles,” and it was introduced by the following note, evidently
suggested if not written by Poe himself.

[“The following lines from a correspondent-besides the deep, quaint
strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some ludicrous
touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless intended by
the author-appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique
rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The resources of
English rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and sound, producing
corresponding diversities of effect, having been thoroughly studied,
much more perceived, by very few poets in the language. While the
classic tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by power of accent,
several advantages for versification over our own, chiefly through
greater abundance of spondaic: feet, we have other and very great
advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme. Alliteration is nearly
the only effect of that kind which the ancients had in common with
us. It will be seen that much of the melody of ‘The Raven’ arises from
alliteration, and the studious use of similar sounds in unusual places.
In regard to its measure, it may be noted that if all the verses were
like the second, they might properly be placed merely in short lines,
producing a not uncommon form; but the presence in all the others of
one line-mostly the second in the verse” (stanza?)--“which flows
continuously, with only an aspirate pause in the middle, like that
before the short line in the Sapphic Adonic, while the fifth has at the
middle pause no similarity of sound with any part besides, gives the
versification an entirely different effect. We could wish the capacities
of our noble language in prosody were better understood.”--ED. “Am.
Rev.”]

2. The bibliographical history of “The Bells” is curious. The subject,
and some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the
poet’s friend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the
poem, headed it, “The Bells, By Mrs. M. A. Shew.” This draft, now the
editor’s property, consists of only seventeen lines, and read thus:

                       I.

     The bells!-ah, the bells!
     The little silver bells!
     How fairy-like a melody there floats
     From their throats--
     From their merry little throats--
     From the silver, tinkling throats
     Of the bells, bells, bells--
     Of the bells!

                       II.

     The bells!-ah, the bells!

     The heavy iron bells!
     How horrible a monody there floats
     From their throats--
     From their deep-toned throats--
     From their melancholy throats!
     How I shudder at the notes Of the bells, bells, bells--
     Of the bells!

In the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it
to the editor of the “Union Magazine.” It was not published. So, in the
following February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much
enlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without
publication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current
version, was sent, and in the following October was published in the
“Union Magazine.”

3. This poem was first published in Colton’s “American Review” for
December, 1847, as “To--Ulalume: a Ballad.” Being reprinted immediately
in the “Home Journal,” it was copied into various publications with the
name of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to him.
When first published, it contained the following additional stanza which
Poe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman, wisely suppressed:

     Said we then--we two, then--“Ah, can it
     Have been that the woodlandish ghouls--
     The pitiful, the merciful ghouls--
     To bar up our path and to ban it
     From the secret that lies in these wolds--
     Had drawn up the spectre of a planet
     From the limbo of lunary souls--
     This sinfully scintillant planet
     From the Hell of the planetary souls?”

4. “To Helen!” (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published until November,
1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the
“Union Magazine,” and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or
desire of Poe, of the line, “Oh, God! oh, Heaven--how my heart beats in
coupling those two words.”

5. “Annabel Lee” was written early in 1849, and is evidently an
expression of the poet’s undying love for his deceased bride,
although at least one of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her
admiration. Poe sent a copy of the ballad to the “Union Magazine,” in
which publication it appeared in January, 1850, three months after the
author’s death. While suffering from “hope deferred” as to its fate,
Poe presented a copy of “Annabel Lee” to the editor of the “Southern
Literary Messenger,” who published it in the November number of his
periodical, a month after Poe’s death. In the meantime the poet’s own
copy, left among his papers, passed into the hands of the person engaged
to edit his works, and he quoted the poem in an obituary of Poe, in the
New York “Tribune,” before any one else had an opportunity of publishing
it.

6. “A Valentine,” one of three poems addressed to Mrs. Osgood, appears
to have been written early in 1846.

7. “An Enigma,” addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewis (“Stella”), was sent
to that lady in a letter, in November, 1847, and the following March
appeared in Sartain’s “Union Magazine.”

8. The sonnet, “To My Mother” (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication to
the short-lived “Flag of our Union,” early in 1849,’ but does not appear
to have been issued until after its author’s death, when it appeared in
the “Leaflets of Memory” for 1850.

9. “For Annie” was first published in the “Flag of our Union,” in the
spring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly
afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the “Home Journal.”

10. “To F----” (Frances Sargeant Osgood) appeared in the “Broadway
journal” for April, 1845. These lines are but slightly varied from those
inscribed “To Mary,” in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for July,
1835, and subsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed, in
“Graham’s Magazine” for March, 1842, as “To One Departed.”

11. “To F----s S. O--d,” a portion of the poet’s triune tribute to Mrs.
Osgood, was published in the “Broadway Journal” for September, 1845.
The earliest version of these lines appeared in the “Southern Literary
Messenger” for September, 1835, as “Lines written in an Album,” and was
addressed to Eliza White, the proprietor’s daughter. Slightly revised,
the poem reappeared in Burton’s “Gentleman’s Magazine” for August, 1839,
as “To--.”

12. Although “Eldorado” was published during Poe’s lifetime, in 1849,
in the “Flag of our Union,” it does not appear to have ever received the
author’s finishing touches.




POEMS OF MANHOOD




LENORE

     AH broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!
     Let the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;
     And, Guy De Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?--weep now or never more!
     See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
     Come! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!--
     An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young--
     A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.

     “Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
     “And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died!
     “How shall the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung
     “By you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue
     “That did to death the innocent that died, and died so young?”

      _Peccavimus_; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song
     Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel so wrong!
     The sweet Lenore hath “gone before,” with Hope, that flew beside
     Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride--
     For her, the fair and _debonair_, that now so lowly lies,
     The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes--
     The life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes.

     “Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,
     “But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days!
     “Let no bell toll!--lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
     “Should catch the note, as it doth float--up from the damned Earth.
     “To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven--
     “From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven--
     “From grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of Heaven.”




TO ONE IN PARADISE.

     THOU wast all that to me, love,
         For which my soul did pine--
     A green isle in the sea, love,
         A fountain and a shrine,
     All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
         And all the flowers were mine.

     Ah, dream too bright to last!
         Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise
     But to be overcast!
         A voice from out the Future cries,
     “On! on!”--but o’er the Past
         (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
     Mute, motionless, aghast!

     For, alas! alas! with me
         The light of Life is o’er!
         No more--no more--no more--
     (Such language holds the solemn sea
         To the sands upon the shore)
     Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
         Or the stricken eagle soar!

     And all my days are trances,
         And all my nightly dreams
     Are where thy dark eye glances,
         And where thy footstep gleams--
     In what ethereal dances,
         By what eternal streams.

1835.




THE COLISEUM.

     TYPE of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary
     Of lofty contemplation left to Time
     By buried centuries of pomp and power!
     At length--at length--after so many days
     Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
     (Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,)
     I kneel, an altered and an humble man,
     Amid thy shadows, and so drink within
     My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!

     Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld!
     Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!
     I feel ye now--I feel ye in your strength--
     O spells more sure than e’er Judæan king
     Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!
     O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee
     Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!

     Here, where a hero fell, a column falls!
     Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
     A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!
     Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
     Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!
     Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,
     Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,
     Lit by the wanlight--wan light of the horned moon,
     The swift and silent lizard of the stones!

     But stay! these walls--these ivy-clad arcades--
     These mouldering plinths--these sad and blackened shafts--
     These vague entablatures--this crumbling frieze--
     These shattered cornices--this wreck--this ruin--
     These stones--alas! these gray stones--are they all--
     All of the famed, and the colossal left
     By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?

     “Not all”--the Echoes answer me--“not all!
     “Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever
     “From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,
     “As melody from Memnon to the Sun.
     “We rule the hearts of mightiest men--we rule
     “With a despotic sway all giant minds.
     “We are not impotent--we pallid stones.
     “Not all our power is gone--not all our fame--
     “Not all the magic of our high renown--
     “Not all the wonder that encircles us--
     “Not all the mysteries that in us lie--
     “Not all the memories that hang upon
     “And cling around about us as a garment,
     “Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.”

1833.




THE HAUNTED PALACE.

     IN the greenest of our valleys
         By good angels tenanted,
     Once a fair and stately palace--
         Radiant palace--reared its head.
     In the monarch Thought’s dominion--
         It stood there!
     Never seraph spread a pinion
         Over fabric half so fair.

     Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
         On its roof did float and flow,
     (This--all this--was in the olden
         Time long ago,)
     And every gentle air that dallied,
         In that sweet day,
     Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
         A winged odour went away.

     Wanderers in that happy valley,
         Through two luminous windows, saw
     Spirits moving musically,
         To a lute’s well-tuned law,
     Round about a throne where, sitting
         (Porphyrogene)
     In state his glory well befitting,
         The ruler of the realm was seen.

     And all with pearl and ruby glowing
         Was the fair palace door,
     Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
         And sparkling evermore,
     A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty
         Was but to sing,
     In voices of surpassing beauty,
         The wit and wisdom of their king.

     But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
         Assailed the monarch’s high estate.
     (Ah, let us mourn!--for never sorrow
         Shall dawn upon him desolate!)
     And round about his home the glory
         That blushed and bloomed,
     Is but a dim-remembered story
         Of the old time entombed.

     And travellers, now, within that valley,
         Through the red-litten windows see
     Vast forms, that move fantastically
         To a discordant melody,
     While, lie a ghastly rapid river,
         Through the pale door
     A hideous throng rush out forever
         And laugh--but smile no more.

1838.




THE CONQUEROR WORM.

     LO! ‘tis a gala night
         Within the lonesome latter years!
     An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
         In veils, and drowned in tears,
     Sit in a theatre, to see
         A play of hopes and fears,
     While the orchestra breathes fitfully
         The music of the spheres.

     Mimes, in the form of God on high,
         Mutter and mumble low,
     And hither and thither fly--
         Mere puppets they, who come and go
     At bidding of vast formless things
         That shift the scenery to and fro,
     Flapping from out their Condor wings
        Invisible Wo!

     That motley drama--oh, be sure
         It shall not be forgot!
     With its Phantom chased for evermore,
         By a crowd that seize it not,
     Through a circle that ever returneth in
         To the self-same spot,
     And much of Madness, and more of Sin,
         And Horror the soul of the plot.

     But see, amid the mimic rout
         A crawling shape intrude!
     A blood-red thing that writhes from out
         The scenic solitude!
     It writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs
         The mimes become its food,
     And the angels sob at vermin fangs
         In human gore imbued.

     Out--out are the lights--out all!
         And, over each quivering form,
     The curtain, a funeral pall,
         Comes down with the rush of a storm,
     And the angels, all pallid and wan,
         Uprising, unveiling, affirm
     That the play is the tragedy, “Man,”
          And its hero the Conqueror Worm.

1838.




SILENCE

     THERE are some qualities--some incorporate things,
         That have a double life, which thus is made
     A type of that twin entity which springs
         From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
     There is a two-fold _Silence_--sea and shore--
         Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
         Newly with grass o’ergrown; some solemn graces,
     Some human memories and tearful lore,
     Render him terrorless: his name’s “No More.”
      He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
         No power hath he of evil in himself;
     But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
         Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
     That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
     No foot of man,) commend thyself to God!

1840.




DREAM-LAND

        BY a route obscure and lonely,
         Haunted by ill angels only,
         Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
         On a black throne reigns upright,
         I have reached these lands but newly
         From an ultimate dim Thule--
         From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
               Out of SPACE--out of TIME.

         Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
         And chasms, and caves, and Titian woods,
         With forms that no man can discover
         For the dews that drip all over;
         Mountains toppling evermore
         Into seas without a shore;
         Seas that restlessly aspire,
         Surging, unto skies of fire;
         Lakes that endlessly outspread
         Their lone waters--lone and dead,--
         Their still waters--still and chilly
         With the snows of the lolling lily.

         By the lakes that thus outspread
         Their lone waters, lone and dead,--
         Their sad waters, sad and chilly
         With the snows of the lolling lily,--
         By the mountains--near the river
         Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,--
         By the grey woods,--by the swamp
         Where the toad and the newt encamp,--
         By the dismal tarns and pools
                 Where dwell the Ghouls,--
         By each spot the most unholy--
         In each nook most melancholy,--
         There the traveller meets aghast
         Sheeted Memories of the Past--
         Shrouded forms that start and sigh
         As they pass the wanderer by--
         White-robed forms of friends long given,
         In agony, to the Earth--and Heaven.

         For the heart whose woes are legion
         ‘Tis a peaceful, soothing region--
         For the spirit that walks in shadow
         ‘Tis--oh ‘tis an Eldorado!
         But the traveller, travelling through it,
         May not--dare not openly view it;
         Never its mysteries are exposed
         To the weak human eye unclosed;
         So wills its King, who hath forbid
         The uplifting of the fringed lid;
         And thus the sad Soul that here passes
         Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

         By a route obscure and lonely,
         Haunted by ill angels only,
         Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
         On a black throne reigns upright,
         I have wandered home but newly
         From this ultimate dim Thule.

1844.




HYMN

     AT morn--at noon--at twilight dim--
     Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
     In joy and wo--in good and ill--
     Mother of God, be with me still!
     When the Hours flew brightly by
     And not a cloud obscured the sky,
     My soul, lest it should truant be,
     Thy grace did guide to thine and thee;
     Now, when storms of Fate o’ercast
     Darkly my Present and my Past,
     Let my Future radiant shine
     With sweet hopes of thee and thine!

1835.




TO ZANTE

     FAIR isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
         Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take
     How many memories of what radiant hours
         At sight of thee and thine at once awake!
     How many scenes of what departed bliss!
         How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!
     How many visions of a maiden that is
         No more--no more upon thy verdant slopes!
     No _more!_ alas, that magical sad sound
         Transfomring all! Thy charms shall please _no more_--
     Thy memory _no more! _Accursed ground
         Henceforth I hold thy flower-enamelled shore,
     O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!
         “Isoa d’oro! Fior di Levante!”

1837.




SCENES FROM “POLITIAN”

AN UNPUBLISHED DRAMA.

                                 I.

              ROME.--A Hall in a Palace  Alessandra and Castiglione.

      Alessandra.  Thou art sad, Castiglione.

      Castiglione.  Sad!--not I.
  Oh, I’m the happiest, happiest man in Rome!
  A few days more, thou knowest, my Alessandra,
  Will make thee mine. Oh, I am very happy!

      Aless.  Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing
  Thy happiness!--what ails thee, cousin of mine?
  Why didst thou sigh so deeply?

      Cas.  Did I sign?
  I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,
  A silly--a most silly fashion I have
  When I am very happy. Did I sigh?                         (sighing.)

      Aless. Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged
  Too much of late, and I am vexed to see it.
  Late hours and wine, Castiglione,--these
  Will ruin thee! thou art already altered--
  Thy looks are haggard--nothing so wears away
  The constitution as late hours and wine.

      Cas. (musing.)  Nothing, fair cousin, nothing--not even deep
  sorrow--
  Wears it away like evil hours and wine.
  I will amend.

      Aless. Do it! I would have thee drop
  Thy riotous company, too--fellows low born--
  Ill suit the like with old Di Broglio’s heir
  And Alessandra’s husband.

      Cas.  I will drop them.

      Aless.   Thou wilt--thou must. Attend thou also more
  To thy dress and equipage--they are over plain
  For thy lofty rank and fashion--much depends
  Upon appearances.

      Cas.  I’ll see to it.

      Aless. Then see to it!--pay more attention, sir,
  To a becoming carriage--much thou wantest
  In dignity.

      Cas.  Much, much, oh! much I want
    In proper dignity.

      Aless.(haughtily)  Thou mockest me, sir!

      Cas. (abstractedly.)  Sweet, gentle Lalage!

      Aless. Heard I aright?
  I speak to him--he speaks of Lalage!
  Sir Count! (places her hand on his shoulder) what art thou dreaming?
  he’s not well!
  What ails thee, sir?

      Cas. (startling.)  Cousin! fair cousin!--madam!
  I crave thy pardon--indeed I am not well--
  Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please.
  This air is most oppressive!--Madam--the Duke!

                                                     Enter Di Broglio.

      Di Broglio.  My son, I’ve news for thee!--hey?--what’s the
  matter? (observing Alessandra)
  I’ the pouts? Kiss her, Castiglione! kiss her,
  You dog! and make it up, I say, this minute!
  I’ve news for you both. Politian is expected
  Hourly in Rome--Politian, Earl of Leicester!
  We’ll have him at the wedding. ‘Tis his first visit
  To the imperial city.

      Aless. What! Politian
  Of Britain, Earl of Leicester?

      Di Brog.  The same, my love.
  We’ll have him at the wedding. A man quite young
  In years, but grey in fame. I have not seen him,
  But Rumour speaks of him as of a prodigy
  Pre-eminent in arts and arms, and wealth,
  And high descent. We’ll have him at the wedding.

      Aless. I have heard much of this Politian.
  Gay, volatile and giddy--is he not?
  And little given to thinking.

      Di Brog.  Far from it, love.
  No branch, they say, of all philosophy
  So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.
  Learned as few are learned.

      Aless. ‘Tis very strange!
  I have known men have seen Politian
  And sought his company. They speak of him
  As of one who entered madly into life,
  Drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs.

      Cas.  Ridiculous! Now I have seen Politian
  And know him well--nor learned nor mirthful he.
  He is a dreamer and a man shut out
  From common passions.

      Di Brog.  Children, we disagree.
  Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air
  Of the garden. Did I dream, or did I hear
  Politian was a melancholy man?                             (exeunt.)

                            II

    ROME. A Lady’s apartment, with a window open and looking into a garden.
  Lalage, in deep mourning, reading at a table on which lie some books and a
  hand mirror. In the background Jacinta (a servant maid) leans carelessly
  upon a chair.

      Lal. [Lalage] Jacinta! is it thou?

      Jac. [Jacinta] (pertly.) Yes, Ma’am, I’m here.

      Lal.   I did not know, Jacinta, you were in waiting.
  Sit down!--Let not my presence trouble you--
  Sit down!--for I am humble, most humble.

      Jac. (aside.) ‘Tis time.
  (Jacinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the chair, resting her
  elbows upon the back, and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous look.
  Lalage continues to read. )

      Lal. “It in another climate, so he said,
  “Bore a bright golden flower, but not i’ this soil!”
   (pauses--turns over some leaves, and resumes)
  “No lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower--
  “But Ocean ever to refresh mankind
  “Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind.”
   O, beautiful!--most beautiful--how like
  To what my fevered soul doth dream of Heaven!
  O happy land (pauses) She died!--the maiden died!
  A still more happy maiden who couldst die!
  Jacinta!
  (Jacinta returns no answer, and Lalage presently resumes.)
  Again!--a similar tale
  Told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea!
  Thus speaketh one Ferdinand in the words of the play--
  “She died full young”--one Bossola answers him--
  “I think not so--her infelicity
  “Seemed to have years too many”--Ah luckless lady!
  Jacinta! (still no answer)

      Here ‘s a far sterner story,
  But like--oh, very like in its despair--
  Of that Egyptian queen, winning so easily
  A thousand hearts--losing at length her own.
  She died. Thus endeth the history--and her maids
  Lean over and weep--two gentle maids
  With gentle names--Eiros and Charmion!
  Rainbow and Dove!----Jacinta!

      Jac. (pettishly.) Madam, what is it?

      Lal.  Wilt thou, my good Jacinta, be so kind
  As go down in the library and bring me
  The Holy Evangelists.

      Jac. Pshaw!   (exit.)

      Lal. If there be balm
  For the wounded spirit in Gilead it is there!
  Dew in the night time of my bitter trouble
  Will there be found--“dew sweeter far than that
  Which hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill.”
   (re-enter Jacinta, and throws a volume on the table.)
  There, ma’am, ‘s the book. Indeed she is very troublesome.  (aside.)

      Lal. (astonished.)  What didst thou say, Jacinta? Have I done aught
  To grieve thee or to vex thee?--I am sorry.
  For thou hast served me long and ever been
  Trust-worthy and respectful.                   (resumes her reading.)

      Jac. I can’t believe
  She has any more jewels--no--no--she gave me all.    (aside.)

      Lal. What didst thou say, Jacinta? Now I bethink me
  Thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding.
  How fares good Ugo?--and when is it to be?
  Can I do aught?--is there no farther aid
  Thou needest, Jacinta?

      Jac. Is there no farther aid!
  That’s meant for me. (aside) I’m sure, madam, you need not
  Be always throwing those jewels in my teeth.

      Lal. Jewels! Jacinta,--now indeed, Jacinta,
  I thought not of the jewels.

      Jac. Oh! perhaps not!
  But then I might have sworn it. After all,
  There ‘s Ugo says the ring is only paste,
  For he ‘s sure the Count Castiglione never
  Would have given a real diamond to such as you;
  And at the best I’m certain, Madam, you cannot
  Have use for jewels now. But I might have sworn it.          (exit.)
  (Lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table--after a
  short pause raises it.)

      Lal.  Poor Lalage!--and is it come to this?
  Thy servant maid!--but courage!--‘tis but a viper
  Whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul!
  (taking up the mirror)
  Ha! here at least ‘s a friend--too much a friend
  In earlier days--a friend will not deceive thee.
  Fair mirror and true! now tell me (for thou canst)
  A tale--a pretty tale--and heed thou not
  Though it be rife with woe: It answers me.
  It speaks of sunken eyes, and wasted cheeks,
  And Beauty long deceased--remembers me
  Of Joy departed--Hope, the Seraph Hope,
  Inurned and entombed:--now, in a tone
  Low, sad, and solemn, but most audible,
  Whispers of early grave untimely yawning
  For ruined maid. Fair mirror and true--thou liest not!
  Thou hast no end to gain--no heart to break--
  Castiglione lied who said he loved--
  Thou true--he false!--false!--false!
  (While she speaks, a monk enters her apartment, and approaches
  unobserved.)

      Monk. Refuge thou hast,
  Sweet daughter, in Heaven. Think of eternal things!
  Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray!

      Lal. (arising hurriedly.)  I cannot pray!--My soul is at war
  with God!
  The frightful sounds of merriment below
  Disturb my senses--go! I cannot pray--
  The sweet airs from the garden worry me!
  Thy presence grieves me--go!--thy priestly raiment
  Fills me with dread--thy ebony crucifix
  With horror and awe!

      Monk. Think of thy precious soul!

      Lal.  Think of my early days!--think of my father
  And mother in Heaven think of our quiet home,
  And the rivulet that ran before the door!
  Think of my little sisters!--think of them!
  And think of me!--think of my trusting love
  And confidence--his vows--my ruin--think--think
  Of my unspeakable misery!--begone!
  Yet stay! yet stay!--what was it thou saidst of prayer
  And penitence? Didst thou not speak of faith
  And vows before the throne?

      Monk.  I did.

      Lal. Lal. ‘Tis well.
  There is a vow were fitting should be made--
  A sacred vow, imperative, and urgent,
  A solemn vow!

      Monk. Daughter, this zeal is well!

      Lal.  Father, this zeal is anything but well!
  Hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?
  A crucifix whereon to register
  This sacred vow?                             (he hands her his own)
  Not that--Oh! no!--no!--no!                            (shuddering)
  Not that! Not that!--I tell thee, holy man,
  Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!
  Stand back! I have a crucifix myself,--
  I have a crucifix Methinks ‘twere fitting
  The deed--the vow--the symbol of the deed--
  And the deed’s register should tally, father!

                  (draws a cross-handled dagger, and raises it on high)
  Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine
  Is written in Heaven!

      Monk. Thy words are madness, daughter,
  And speak a purpose unholy--thy lips are livid--
  Thine eyes are wild--tempt not the wrath divine!
  Pause ere too late!--oh, be not--be not rash!
  Swear not the oath--oh, swear it not!

      Lal. ‘Tis sworn!

                          III.

        An apartment in a Palace. Politian and Baldazzar.

       Baldazzar.------Arouse thee now, Politian!
  Thou must not--nay indeed, indeed, shalt not
  Give away unto these humors. Be thyself!
  Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee,
  And live, for now thou diest!

       Politian.  Not so, Baldazzar! Surely I live.

       Bal. Politian, it doth grieve me
  To see thee thus.

      Pol.  Baldazzar, it doth grieve me
  To give thee cause for grief, my honoured friend.
  Command me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?
  At thy behest I will shake off that nature
  Which from my, forefathers I did inherit,
  Which with my mother’s milk I did imbibe,
  And be no more Politian, but some other.
  Command me, sir!

      Bal.  To the field, then--to the field--
  To the senate or the field.

      Pol. Alas! Alas!
  There is an imp would follow me even there!
  There is an imp hath followed me even there!
  There is--what voice was that?

      Bal.  I heard it not.
  I heard not any voice except thine own,
  And the echo of thine own.

      Pol.  Then I but dreamed.

      Bal.  Give not thy soul to dreams: the camp--the court,
  Befit thee--Fame awaits thee--Glory calls--
  And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear
  In hearkening to imaginary sounds
  And phantom voices.

      Pol.  It is a phantom voice!
  Didst thou not hear it then?

      Bal.  I heard it not.

      Pol.  Thou heardst it not!--Baldazaar, speak no more
  To me, Politian, of thy camps and courts.
  Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,
  Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities
  Of the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile!
  We have been boys together--schoolfellows--
  And now are friends--yet shall not be so long--
  For in the eternal city thou shalt do me
  A kind and gentle office, and a Power--
  A Power august, benignant and supreme--
  Shall then absolve thee of all further duties
  Unto thy friend.

      Bal.  Thou speakest a fearful riddle
  I will not understand.

      Pol.  Yet now as Fate
  Approaches, and the Hours are breathing low,
  The sands of Time are changed to golden grains,
  And dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!
  I cannot die, having within my heart
  So keen a relish for the beautiful
  As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air
  Is balmier now than it was wont to be--
  Rich melodies are floating in the winds--
  A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth--
  And with a holier lustre the quiet moon
  Sitteth in Heaven.--Hist! hist! thou canst not say
  Thou hearest not now, Baldazzar?

      Bal.  Indeed I hear not.

      Pol.  Not hear it!--listen now!--listen!--the faintest sound
  And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!
  A lady’s voice!--and sorrow in the tone!
  Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!
  Again!--again!--how solemnly it falls
  Into my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice
  Surely I never heard--yet it were well
  Had I but heard it with its thrilling tones
  In earlier days!

      Bal.  I myself hear it now.
  Be still!--the voice, if I mistake not greatly,
  Proceeds from yonder lattice--which you may see
  Very plainly through the window--it belongs,
  Does it not? unto this palace of the Duke.
  The singer is undoubtedly beneath
  The roof of his Excellency--and perhaps
  Is even that Alessandra of whom he spoke
  As the betrothed of Castiglione,
  His son and heir.

      Pol.  Be still!--it comes again!

      Voice        “And is thy heart so strong
  (very faintly)   As for to leave me thus
              Who hath loved thee so long

              In wealth and woe among?
              And is thy heart so strong
              As for to leave me thus?
                  Say nay--say nay!”

      Bal.  The song is English, and I oft have heard it
  In merry England--never so plaintively--
  Hist! hist! it comes again!

      Voice            “Is it so strong
  (more loudly)    As for to leave me thus
              Who hath loved thee so long
              In wealth and woe among?
              And is thy heart so strong
              As for to leave me thus?
                  Say nay--say nay!”

      Bal.  ‘Tis hushed and all is still!

      Pol.  All is not still!

      Bal.  Let us go down.

      Pol.  Go down, Baldazzar, go!

      Bal.  The hour is growing late--the Duke awaits use--
  Thy presence is expected in the hall
  Below. What ails thee, Earl Politian?

      Voice           “Who hath loved thee so long
  (distinctly)        In wealth and woe among,

                          And is thy heart so strong?

                               Say nay--say nay!”

      Bal.  Let us descend!--‘tis time. Politian, give
  These fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,
  Your bearing lately savored much of rudeness
  Unto the Duke. Arouse thee! and remember

      Pol.  Remember? I do. Lead on! I do remember.

                                                  (going.)
  Let us descend. Believe me I would give,
  Freely would give the broad lands of my earldom
  To look upon the face hidden by yon lattice--
  “To gaze upon that veiled face, and hear
  Once more that silent tongue.”

      Bal.  Let me beg you, sir,
  Descend with me--the Duke may be offended.
  Let us go down, I pray you.

      (Voice loudly) Say nay!--say nay!

      Pol. (aside)  ‘Tis strange!--‘tis very strange--methought the
  voice
  Chimed in with my desires, and bade me stay!

                                     (approaching the window.)
  Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.
  Now be this Fancy, by Heaven, or be it Fate,
  Still will I not descend. Baldazzar, make
  Apology unto the Duke for me;
  I go not down to-night.

      Bal.  Your lordship’s pleasure
  Shall be attended to. Good-night, Politian.

      Pol.  Good-night, my friend, good-night.

                           IV.

             The gardens of a Palace--Moonlight Lalage and Politian.

      Lalge.  And dost thou speak of love
  To me, Politian?--dost thou speak of love
  To Lalage?--ah, woe--ah, woe is me!
  This mockery is most cruel--most cruel indeed!

      Politian.  Weep not! oh, sob not thus!--thy bitter tears
  Will madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage--
  Be comforted! I know--I know it all,
  And still I speak of love. Look at me, brightest
  And beautiful Lalage!--turn here thine eyes!
  Thou askest me if I could speak of love,
  Knowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen.
  Thou askest me that--and thus I answer thee--
  Thus on my bended knee I answer thee.                    (kneeling.)
  Sweet Lalage, I love thee--love thee--love thee;
  Thro’ good and ill--thro’ weal and wo I love thee.
  Not mother, with her first-born on her knee,
  Thrills with intenser love than I for thee.
  Not on God’s altar, in any time or clime,
  Burned there a holier fire than burneth now
  Within my spirit for thee. And do I love?                 (arising.)
  Even for thy woes I love thee--even for thy woes-
  Thy beauty and thy woes.

      Lal.  Alas, proud Earl,
  Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!
  How, in thy father’s halls, among the maidens
  Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,
  Could the dishonored Lalage abide?
  Thy wife, and with a tainted memory-
  MY seared and blighted name, how would it tally
  With the ancestral honors of thy house,
  And with thy glory?

      Pol.  Speak not to me of glory!
  I hate--I loathe the name; I do abhor
  The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.
  Art thou not Lalage and I Politian?
  Do I not love--art thou not beautiful-
  What need we more? Ha! glory!--now speak not of it.
  By all I hold most sacred and most solemn-
  By all my wishes now--my fears hereafter-
  By all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven-
  There is no deed I would more glory in,
  Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory
  And trample it under foot. What matters it-
  What matters it, my fairest, and my best,
  That we go down unhonored and forgotten
  Into the dust--so we descend together.
  Descend together--and then--and then, perchance-

      Lal.  Why dost thou pause, Politian?

      Pol.  And then, perchance
  Arise together, Lalage, and roam
  The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,
  And still-

      Lal.  Why dost thou pause, Politian?

      Pol.  And still together--together.

      Lal.  Now Earl of Leicester!
  Thou lovest me, and in my heart of hearts
  I feel thou lovest me truly.

      Pol.  Oh, Lalage!

                                       (throwing himself upon his knee.)
  And lovest thou me?

      Lal.  Hist! hush! within the gloom
  Of yonder trees methought a figure passed-
  A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless-
  Like the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.

                                             (walks across and returns.)
  I was mistaken--‘twas but a giant bough
  Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!

      Pol.  My Lalage--my love! why art thou moved?
  Why dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience’ self,
  Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,
  Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind
  Is chilly--and these melancholy boughs
  Throw over all things a gloom.

      Lal.  Politian!
  Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land
  With which all tongues are busy--a land new found--
  Miraculously found by one of Genoa--
  A thousand leagues within the golden west?
  A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,
  And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,
  And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds
  Of Heaven untrammelled flow--which air to breathe
  Is Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter
  In days that are to come?

      Pol.  O, wilt thou--wilt thou
  Fly to that Paradise--my Lalage, wilt thou
  Fly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,
  And Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.
  And life shall then be mine, for I will live
  For thee, and in thine eyes--and thou shalt be
  No more a mourner--but the radiant Joys
  Shall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope
  Attend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee
  And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,
  My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,
  My all;--oh, wilt thou--wilt thou, Lalage,
  Fly thither with me?

      Lal.  A deed is to be done--
  Castiglione lives!

      Pol.  And he shall die!                                (exit)

      Lal. (after a pause.)  And--he--shall--die!--alas!
  Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?
  Where am I?--what was it he said?--Politian!
  Thou art not gone--thou are not gone, Politian!
  I feel thou art not gone--yet dare not look,
  Lest I behold thee not; thou couldst not go
  With those words upon thy lips--O, speak to me!
  And let me hear thy voice--one word--one word,
  To say thou art not gone,--one little sentence,
  To say how thou dost scorn--how thou dost hate
  My womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou art not gone-
  O speak to me! I knew thou wouldst not go!
  I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, durst not go.
  Villain, thou art not gone--thou mockest me!
  And thus I clutch thee--thus!--He is gone, he is gone
  Gone--gone. Where am I?--‘tis well--‘tis very well!
  So that the blade be keen--the blow be sure,
  ‘Tis well, ‘tis very well--alas! alas!

                            V.

                 The suburbs. Politian alone.

      Politian.  This weakness grows upon me. I am faint,
  And much I fear me ill--it will not do
  To die ere I have lived!--Stay, stay thy hand,
  O Azrael, yet awhile!--Prince of the Powers
  Of Darkness and the Tomb, O pity me!
  O pity me! let me not perish now,
  In the budding of my Paradisal Hope!
  Give me to live yet--yet a little while:
  ‘Tis I who pray for life--I who so late
  Demanded but to die!--what sayeth the Count?

                    Enter Baldazzar.

      Baldazzar.  That knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud
  Between the Earl Politian and himself.
  He doth decline your cartel.

      Pol.  What didst thou say?
  What answer was it you brought me, good Baldazzar?
  With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes
  Laden from yonder bowers!--a fairer day,
  Or one more worthy Italy, methinks
  No mortal eyes have seen!--what said the Count?

      Bal.  That he, Castiglione’ not being aware
  Of any feud existing, or any cause
  Of quarrel between your lordship and himself,
  Cannot accept the challenge.

      Pol.  It is most true--
  All this is very true. When saw you, sir,
  When saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid
  Ungenial Britain which we left so lately,
  A heaven so calm as this--so utterly free
  From the evil taint of clouds?--and he did say?

      Bal.  No more, my lord, than I have told you, sir:
  The Count Castiglione will not fight,
  Having no cause for quarrel.

      Pol.  Now this is true-
  All very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,
  And I have not forgotten it--thou’lt do me
  A piece of service; wilt thou go back and say
  Unto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,
  Hold him a villain?--thus much, I prythee, say
  Unto the Count--it is exceeding just
  He should have cause for quarrel.

      Bal.  My lord!--my friend!-

      Pol.  (aside.) ‘Tis he!--he comes himself? (aloud) Thou reasonest
  well.
  I know what thou wouldst say--not send the message-
  Well!--I will think of it--I will not send it.
  Now prythee, leave me--hither doth come a person
  With whom affairs of a most private nature
  I would adjust.

      Bal.  I go--to-morrow we meet,
  Do we not?--at the Vatican.

      Pol.  At the Vatican.                                     (exit
  Bal.)

                    Enter Castigilone.

      Cas.  The Earl of Leicester here!

      Pol.  I am the Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,
  Dost thou not? that I am here.

      Cas.  My lord, some strange,
  Some singular mistake--misunderstanding--
  Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged
  Thereby, in heat of anger, to address
  Some words most unaccountable, in writing,
  To me, Castiglione; the bearer being
  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware
  Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,
  Having given thee no offence. Ha!--am I right?
  ‘Twas a mistake?--undoubtedly--we all
  Do err at times.

      Pol.  Draw, villain, and prate no more!

      Cas.  Ha!--draw?--and villain? have at thee then at once,
  Proud Earl!                                   (draws.)

      Pol.  (drawing.)  Thus to the expiatory tomb,
  Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee
  In the name of Lalage!

      Cas.  (letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the
  stage)

                      Of Lalage!
  Hold off--thy sacred hand!--avaunt, I say!
  Avaunt--I will not fight thee--indeed I dare not.

      Pol.  Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?
  Shall I be baffled thus?--now this is well;
  Didst say thou darest not? Ha!

      Cas.  I dare not--dare not--
  Hold off thy hand--with that beloved name
  So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee--
  I cannot--dare not.

      Pol.  Now by my halidom
  I do believe thee!--coward, I do believe thee!

      Cas.  Ha!--coward!--this may not be!

       (clutches his sword and staggers towards POLITIAN, but his purpose
  is changed before reaching him, and he falls upon his knee at the feet of
  the Earl)

                             Alas! my lord,
  It is--it is--most true. In such a cause
  I am the veriest coward. O pity me!

      Pol.  (greatly softened.)  Alas!--I do--indeed I pity thee.

      Cas.  And Lalage-

      Pol.  Scoundrel!--arise and die!

      Cas.  It needeth not be--thus--thus--O let me die
  Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting
  That in this deep humiliation I perish.
  For in the fight I will not raise a hand
  Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home--

                                                     (baring his bosom.)
  Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon-
  Strike home. I will not fight thee.

      Pol.  Now, s’ Death and Hell!
  Am I not--am I not sorely--grievously tempted
  To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir,
  Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare
  For public insult in the streets--before
  The eyes of the citizens. I’ll follow thee
  Like an avenging spirit I’ll follow thee
  Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest-
  Before all Rome I’ll taunt thee, villain,--I’ll taunt thee,
  Dost hear? with cowardice--thou wilt not fight me?
  Thou liest! thou shalt!                                      (exit.)

      Cas.  Now this indeed is just!
  Most righteous, and most just, avenging Heaven!

NOTE

29. Such portions of “Politian” as are known to the public first saw the
light of publicity in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for December,
1835, and January, 1836, being styled “Scenes from Politian: an
unpublished drama.” These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845
collection of Poems, by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft
subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not
considered just to the poet’s memory to publish it. The work is a hasty
and unrevised production of its author’s earlier days of literary labor;
and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance
his reputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the
following fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered.
The Duke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of
Castiglione her betrothed.

      Duke. Why do you laugh?

      Castiglione. Indeed

  I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not
  On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?
  Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.
  Alessandra, you and 1, you must remember!
  We were walking in the garden.

      Duke, Perfectly.
  I do remember it-what of it-what then?

      Cas. 0 nothing-nothing at all.

      Duke. Nothing at all!
  It is most singular that you should laugh
  ‘At nothing at all!

      Cas. Most singular-singular!

      Duke. Look you, Castiglione, be so kind
  As tell me, sir, at once what ‘tis you mean.
  What are you talking of?

      Cas. Was it not so?
  We differed in opinion touching him.

      Duke. Him!--Whom?

      Cas. Why, sir, the Earl Politian.

      Duke. The Earl of Leicester! Yes!--is it he you mean?
  We differed, indeed. If I now recollect
  The words you used were that the Earl you knew
  Was neither learned nor mirthful.

      Cas. Ha! ha!--now did I?

      Duke. That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time
  You were wrong, it being not the character
  Of the Earl-whom all the world allows to be
  A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,
  Too positive again.

      Cas. ‘Tis singular!
  Most singular! I could not think it possible
  So little time could so much alter one!
  To say the truth about an hour ago,
  As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,
  All arm in arm, we met this very man
  The Earl-he, with his friend Baldazzar,
  Having just arrived in Rome. Hal ha! he is altered!
  Such an account he gave me of his journey!
  ‘Twould have made you die with laughter-such tales he told
  Of his caprices and his merry freaks
  Along the road-such oddity-such humor--
  Such wit-such whim-such flashes of wild merriment
  Set off too in such full relief by the grave
  Demeanor of his friend-who, to speak the truth,
  Was gravity itself--

      Duke. Did I not tell you?

      Cas. You did-and yet ‘tis strange! but true as strange,
  How much I was mistaken! I always thought
  The Earl a gloomy man.

      Duke. So, so, you see! Be not too positive. Whom have we here?
  It can not be the Earl?

      Cas. The Earl! Oh, no! ‘Tis not the Earl-but yet it is-and leaning
  Upon his friend Baldazzar. AM welcome, sir!

  (Enter Politian and Baldazzar.)
  My lord, a second welcome let me give you
  To Rome-his Grace the Duke of Broglio.
  Father! this is the Earl Politian, Earl
  Of Leicester in Great Britain. [Politian bows haughtily.]
      That, his friend
  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. The Earl has letters,
  So please you, for Your Grace.

      Duke. Hal ha! Most welcome
  To Rome and to our palace, Earl Politian!
  And you, most noble Duke! I am glad to see you!
  I knew your father well, my Lord Politian.
  Castiglione! call your cousin hither,
  And let me make the noble Earl acquainted
  With your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time
  Most seasonable. The wedding--

      Politian. Touching those letters, sir,
  Your son made mention of--your son, is he not?
  Touching those letters, sir, I wot not of them.
  If such there be, my friend Baldazzar here--
  Baldazzar! ah!--my friend Baldazzar here
  Will hand them to Your Grace. I would retire.

      Duke. Retire!--So soon?

  Came What ho! Benito! Rupert!
  His lordship’s chambers-show his lordship to them!
  His lordship is unwell.     (Enter Benito.)

      Ben. This way, my lord! (Exit, followed by Politian.)

      Duke. Retire! Unwell!

      Bal. So please you, sir. I fear me
  ‘Tis as you say--his lordship is unwell.
  The damp air of the evening-the fatigue
  Of a long journey--the--indeed I had better
  Follow his lordship. He must be unwell.
  I will return anon.

      Duke. Return anon!
  Now this is very strange! Castiglione!
  This way, my son, I wish to speak with thee.
  You surely were mistaken in what you said
  Of the Earl, mirthful, indeed!--which of us said
  Politian was a melancholy man?    (Exeunt.)




POEMS OF YOUTH




INTRODUCTION TO POEMS--1831




_LETTER TO MR. B--._

                                  “WEST POINT, 1831.

“DEAR B......... Believing only a portion of my former volume to be
worthy a second edition-that small portion I thought it as well to
include in the present book as to republish by itself. I have therefore
herein combined ‘Al Aaraaf’ and ‘Tamerlane’ with other poems hitherto
unprinted. Nor have I hesitated to insert from the ‘Minor Poems,’ now
omitted, whole lines, and even passages, to the end that being placed
in a fairer light, and the trash shaken from them in which they were
imbedded, they may have some chance of being seen by posterity.

“It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by
one who is no poet himself. This, according to your idea and _mine _of
poetry, I feel to be false-the less poetical the critic, the less just
the critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are
but few B-’s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world’s
good opinion as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here
observe, ‘Shakespeare is in possession of the world’s good opinion, and
yet Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world
judge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?’
The difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word ‘judgment’ or
‘opinion.’ The opinion is the world’s, truly, but it may be called
theirs as a man would call a book his, having bought it; he did not
write the book, but it is his; they did not originate the opinion, but
it is theirs. A fool, for example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet-yet
the fool has never read Shakespeare. But the fool’s neighbor, who is a
step higher on the Andes of the mind, whose head (that is to say,
his more exalted thought) is too far above the fool to be seen or
understood, but whose feet (by which I mean his everyday actions)
are sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means of which that
superiority is ascertained, which but for them would never have been
discovered-this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great poet--the
fool believes him, and it is henceforward his _opinion. _This neighbor’s
own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one above him,
and so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the
summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands upon the
pinnacle.

“You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer.
He is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit
of the world. I say established; for it is with literature as with law
or empire-an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in
possession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,
improve by travel-their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a
distinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops
glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the
mystic characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely so
many letters of recommendation.

“I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think the
notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is
another. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent
would be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad
poet would, I grant, make a false critique, and his self-love would
infallibly bias his little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is
indeed a poet, could not, I think, fail of making-a just critique;
whatever should be deducted on the score of self-love might be replaced
on account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject; in short,
we have more instances of false criticism than of just where one’s own
writings are the test, simply because we have more bad poets than good.
There are, of course, many objections to what I say: Milton is a great
example of the contrary; but his opinion with respect to the
‘Paradise Regained’ is by no means fairly ascertained. By what trivial
circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really
believe! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity. But,
in fact, the ‘Paradise Regained’ is little, if at all, inferior to the
‘Paradise Lost,’ and is only supposed so to be because men do not like
epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and, reading those of
Milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the first to
derive any pleasure from the second.

“I dare say Milton preferred ‘Comus’ to either-. if so-justly.

“As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon
the most singular heresy in its modern history-the heresy of what is
called, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have
been induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal
refutation of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of
supererogation. The wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge
and Southey, but, being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so
prosaically exemplifled.

“Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most
philosophical of all writings*-but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce
it the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry
is, or should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our
existence is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our
existence, everything connected with our existence, should be still
happiness. Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and
happiness is another name for pleasure;-therefore the end of instruction
should be pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion implies
precisely the reverse.

“To proceed: _ceteris paribus,_ he who pleases is of more importance to
his fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and
pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the
means of obtaining.

“I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume
themselves so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they
refer to instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere
respect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for
their judgment; contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since
their writings are professedly to be understood by the few, and it is
the many who stand in need of salvation. In such case I should no doubt
be tempted to think of the devil in ‘Melmoth.’ who labors indefatigably,
through three octavo volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one
or two souls, while any common devil would have demolished one or two
thousand.

“Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study-not a passion-it
becomes the metaphysician to reason-but the poet to protest.
Yet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbued in
contemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and
learning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute their
authority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of my
heart, that learning has little to do with the imagination-intellect
with the passions-or age with poetry.

     “‘Trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;
     He who would search for pearls must dive below,’

are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths,
men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truth
lies in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought-not in the palpable
palaces where she is found. The ancients were not always right in
hiding--the goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown
upon philosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith--that moral
mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom
of a man.

“We see an instance of Coleridge’s liability to err, in his ‘Biographia
Literaria’--professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact, a
treatise _de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis. _He goes wrong by reason
of his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in the
contemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely sees,
it is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray-while he who
surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is
useful to us below-its brilliancy and its beauty.

“As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth the
feelings of a poet I believe-for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy
in his writings-(and delicacy is the poet’s own kingdom-his _El
Dorado)-but they _have the appearance of a better day recollected; and
glimpses, at best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know
that a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the
glacier.

“He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end
of poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the light
which should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequently
is too correct. This may not be understood-but the old Goths of Germany
would have understood it, who used to debate matters of importance to
their State twice, once when drunk, and once when sober-sober that they
might not be deficient in formality--drunk lest they should be destitute
of vigor.

“The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into
admiration of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are
full of such assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes at
random)--‘Of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is
worthy to be done, and what was never done before;’-indeed? then it
follows that in doing what is unworthy to be done, or what _has _been
done before, no genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an
unworthy act, pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington,
the pickpocket, in point of genius, would have thought hard of a
comparison with William Wordsworth, the poet.

“Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be
Ossian’s or Macpherson’s can surely be of little consequence, yet, in
order to prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages in
the controversy. _Tantaene animis? _Can great minds descend to such
absurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument in
favor of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his
abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathize. It is the
beginning of the epic poem ‘Temora.’ ‘The blue waves of Ullin roll in
light; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty
heads in the breeze.’ And this this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where
all is alive and panting with immortality-this, William Wordsworth, the
author of ‘Peter Bell,’ has _selected _for his contempt. We shall see
what better he, in his own person, has to offer. Imprimis:

     “‘And now she’s at the pony’s tail,
     And now she’s at the pony’s head,
     On that side now, and now on this;
     And, almost stifled with her bliss,

     A few sad tears does Betty shed....
     She pats the pony, where or when
     She knows not.... happy Betty Foy!
     Oh, Johnny, never mind the doctor!’

Secondly:

     “‘The dew was falling fast, the-stars began to blink;
     I heard a voice: it said-“Drink, pretty creature, drink!”
      And, looking o’er the hedge, be-fore me I espied
     A snow-white mountain lamb, with a-maiden at its side.
     No other sheep was near,--the lamb was all alone,
     And by a slender cord was-tether’d to a stone.’

“Now, we have no doubt this is all true: we will believe it, indeed we
will, Mr. W. Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite? I love a
sheep from the bottom of my heart.

“But there are occasions, dear B-, there are occasions when even
Wordsworth is reasonable. Even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end,
and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. Here is an
extract from his preface:-

“‘Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modem writers, if
they persist in reading this book to a conclusion _(impossible!) will,
_no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha! ha! ha!)
they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will be induced
to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have been
permitted to assume that title.’ Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!

“Yet, let not Mr. W. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, and
the bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified
a tragedy with a chorus of turkeys.

“Of Coleridge, I can not speak but with reverence. His towering
intellect! his gigantic power! To use an author quoted by himself,
_‘Tai trouvé souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une bonne
partie de ce qu’elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu’elles nient,’ and
_to employ his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions by
the barrier he has erected against those of others. It is lamentable to
think that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like the
Nyctanthes, waste its perfume upon the night alone. In reading that
man’s poetry, I tremble like one who stands upon a volcano, conscious
from the very darkness bursting from the crater, of the fire and the
light that are weltering below.

“What is poetry?--Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as many
appellations as the nine-titled Corcyra! ‘Give me,’ I demanded of
a scholar some time ago, ‘give me a definition of poetry.’
_‘Trèsvolontiers;’ _and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr.
Johnson, and overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortal
Shakespeare! I imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon
the profanity of that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dear B-,
think of poetry, and then think of Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think of all that
is airy and fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy;
think of his huge bulk, the Elephant! and then-and then think of the
‘Tempest’--the ‘Midsummer-Night’s Dream’--Prospero Oberon--and Titania!

“A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for
its _immediate _object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, for
its object, an _indefinite _instead of a _definite _pleasure, being
a poem only so far as this object is attained; romance presenting
perceptible images with definite, poetry with indefinite sensations,
to which end music is an _essential, since _the comprehension of sweet
sound is our most indefinite conception. Music, when combined with a
pleasurable idea, is poetry; music, without the idea, is simply music;
the idea, wi thout the music, is prose, from its very definitiveness.

“What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his
soul?

“To sum up this long rigmarole, I have, dear B--, what you, no doubt,
perceive, for the metaphysical poets as poets, the most sovereign
contempt. That they have followers proves nothing-

     “‘No Indian prince has to his palace
     More followers than a thief to the gallows.




SONNET--TO SCIENCE

     SCIENCE! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
         Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
     Why preyest thou thus upon the poet’s heart,
         Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?
     How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
         Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
     To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies
         Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
     Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
         And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
     To seek a shelter in some happier star?
         Hast thous not torn the Naiad from her flood,
     The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
         The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?




AL AARAAF (*)

     PART I.

          O!  NOTHING earthly save the ray
          (Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty’s eye,
          As in those gardens where the day
          Springs from the gems of Circassy--
          O! nothing earthly save the thrill
          Of melody in woodland rill--
          Or (music of the passion-hearted)
          Joy’s voice so peacefully departed
          That like the murmur in the shell,
          Its echo dwelleth and will dwell--
          Oh, nothing of the dross of ours--
          Yet all the beauty--all the flowers
          That list our Love, and deck our bowers--
          Adorn yon world afar, afar--
          The wandering star.

             ‘Twas a sweet time for Nesace--for there
          Her world lay lolling on the golden air,
          Near four bright suns--a temporary rest--
          An oasis in desert of the blest.

     * A star was discovered by Tycho Brahe which appeared
     suddenly in the heavens--attained, in a few days, a
     brilliancy surpassing that of Jupiter--then as suddenly
     disappeared, and has never been seen since.

          Away--away--‘mid seas of rays that roll
          Empyrean splendor o’er th’ unchained soul--
          The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)
          Can struggle to its destin’d eminence--
          To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,
          And late to ours, the favour’d one of God--
          But, now, the ruler of an anchor’d realm,
          She throws aside the sceptre--leaves the helm,
          And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,
          Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.

              Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,
          Whence sprang the “Idea of Beauty” into birth,
          (Falling in wreaths thro’ many a startled star,
          Like woman’s hair ‘mid pearls, until, afar,
          It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt)
          She look’d into Infinity--and knelt.
          Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled--
          Fit emblems of the model of her world--
          Seen but in beauty--not impeding sight
          Of other beauty glittering thro’ the light--
          A wreath that twined each starry form around,
          And all the opal’d air in color bound.

              All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
          Of flowers:  of lilies such as rear’d the head
          *On the fair Capo Deucato, and sprang
          So eagerly around about to hang
          Upon the flying footsteps of--deep pride--
          †Of her who lov’d a mortal--and so died.
          The Sephalica, budding with young bees,
          Uprear’d its purple stem around her knees:

     * On Santa Maura--olim Deucadia.

          *And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam’d--
          Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham’d
          All other loveliness: its honied dew
          (The fabled nectar that the heathen knew)
          Deliriously sweet, was dropp’d from Heaven,
          And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
          In Trebizond--and on a sunny flower
          So like its own above that, to this hour,
          It still remaineth, torturing the bee
          With madness, and unwonted reverie:
          In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf
          And blossom of the fairy plant, in grief
          Disconsolate linger--grief that hangs her head,
          Repenting follies that full long have fled,
          Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,
          Like guilty beauty, chasten’d, and more fair:
          Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light
          She fears to perfume, perfuming the night:
          **And Clytia pondering between many a sun,
          While pettish tears adown her petals run:
          ***And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth--
          And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,
          Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
          Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king:

     * This flower is much noticed by Lewenhoeck and Tournefort.
     The bee, feeding upon its blossom, becomes intoxicated.

     ** Clytia--The Chrysanthemum Peruvianum, or, to employ a
     better-known term, the turnsol--which continually turns
     towards the sun, covers itself, like Peru, the country from
     which it comes, with dewy clouds which cool and refresh its
     flowers during the most violent heat of the day.--_B. de St.
     Pierre_.

     *** There is cultivated in the king’s garden at Paris, a
     species of serpentine aloes without prickles, whose large
     and beautiful flower exhales a strong odour of the vanilla,
     during the time of its expansion, which is very short. It
     does not blow till towards the month of July--you then
     perceive it gradually open its petals--expand them--fade
     and die.--_St. Pierre_.

     *And Valisnerian lotus thither flown
     From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:
     **And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante!
     Isola d’oro!--Fior di Levante!
     ***And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever
     With Indian Cupid down the holy river--
     Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given
     ****To bear the Goddess’ song, in odors, up to Heaven:

        “Spirit! that dwellest where,
              In the deep sky,
          The terrible and fair,
              In beauty vie!
          Beyond the line of blue--
              The boundary of the star
          Which turneth at the view
              Of thy barrier and thy bar--
          Of the barrier overgone
             By the comets who were cast
          From their pride, and from their throne
             To be drudges till the last--
          To be carriers of fire
             (The red fire of their heart)
          With speed that may not tire
             And with pain that shall not part--

     * There is found, in the Rhone, a beautiful lily of the
     Valisnerian kind. Its stem will stretch to the length of
     three or four feet--thus preserving its head above water
     in the swellings of the river.

     ** The Hyacinth.

     *** It is a fiction of the Indians, that Cupid was first
     seen floating in one of these down the river Ganges--and
     that he still loves the cradle of his childhood.

    **** And golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints.
   --Rev. St. John.

          Who livest--_that_ we know--
              In Eternity--we feel--
          But the shadow of whose brow
              What spirit shall reveal?
          Tho’ the beings whom thy Nesace,
              Thy messenger hath known
          Have dream’d for thy Infinity
              *A model of their own--
          Thy will is done, Oh, God!
              The star hath ridden high
          Thro’ many a tempest, but she rode
              Beneath thy burning eye;
          And here, in thought, to thee--
              In thought that can alone
          Ascend thy empire and so be
              A partner of thy throne--

     * The Humanitarians held that God was to be understood as
     having a really human form.--_Vide Clarke’s Sermons_, vol.
     1, page 26, fol. edit.

     The drift of Milton’s argument, leads him to employ language
     which would appear, at first sight, to verge upon their
     doctrine;  but it will be seen immediately, that he guards
     himself against the charge of having adopted one of the most
     ignorant errors of the dark ages of the church.--_Dr.
     Sumner’s Notes on Milton’s Christian Doctrine_.

     This opinion, in spite of many testimonies to the contrary,
     could never have been very general. Andeus, a Syrian of
     Mesopotamia, was condemned for the opinion, as heretical. He
     lived in the beginning of the fourth century. His disciples
     were called Anthropmorphites.--_Vide Du Pin_.

     Among Milton’s poems are these lines:--
                Dicite sacrorum præsides nemorum Deæ, &c.
                Quis ille primus cujus ex imagine
                Natura solers finxit humanum genus?
                Eternus, incorruptus, æquævus polo,
                Unusque et universus exemplar Dei.--And afterwards,
                Non cui profundum Cæcitas lumen dedit
                Dircæus augur vidit hunc alto sinu, &c.

          *By winged Fantasy,
              My embassy is given,
          Till secrecy shall knowledge be
              In the environs of Heaven.”

          She ceas’d--and buried then her burning cheek
          Abash’d, amid the lilies there, to seek
          A shelter from the fervour of His eye;
          For the stars trembled at the Deity.
          She stirr’d not--breath’d not--for a voice was there
          How solemnly pervading the calm air!
          A sound of silence on the startled ear
          Which dreamy poets name “the music of the sphere.”
           Ours is a world of words:  Quiet we call
          “Silence”--which is the merest word of all.
          All Nature speaks, and ev’n ideal things
          Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings--
          But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high
          The eternal voice of God is passing by,
          And the red winds are withering in the sky!

          ** “What tho’ in worlds which sightless cycles run,
          Link’d to a little system, and one sun--
          Where all my love is folly and the crowd
          Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,
          The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath--
          (Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?)
          What tho’ in worlds which own a single sun
          The sands of Time grow dimmer as they run,

     * Seltsamen Tochter Jovis
       Seinem Schosskinde
       Der Phantasie.--_Göethe_.

    ** Sightless--too small to be seen--_Legge_.

          Yet thine is my resplendency, so given
          To bear my secrets thro’ the upper Heaven.
          Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,
          With all thy train, athwart the moony sky--
          *Apart--like fire-flies in Sicilian night,
          And wing to other worlds another light!
          Divulge the secrets of thy embassy
          To the proud orbs that twinkle--and so be
          To ev’ry heart a barrier and a ban
          Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!”

              Up rose the maiden in the yellow night,
          The single-mooned eve!--on Earth we plight
          Our faith to one love--and one moon adore--
          The birth-place of young Beauty had no more.
          As sprang that yellow star from downy hours
          Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,
          And bent o’er sheeny mountain and dim plain
          **Her way--but left not yet her Therasæan reign.

     * I have often noticed a peculiar movement of the fire-flies;
    --they will collect in a body and fly off, from a common
     centre, into innumerable radii.

     ** Therasæa, or Therasea, the island mentioned by Seneca,
     which, in a moment, arose from the sea to the eyes of
     astonished mariners.


                         Part II.

          HIGH on a mountain of enamell’d head--
          Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
          Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,
          Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees
          With many a mutter’d “hope to be forgiven”
           What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven--
          Of rosy head, that towering far away
          Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
          Of sunken suns at eve--at noon of night,
          While the moon danc’d with the fair stranger light--
          Uprear’d upon such height arose a pile
          Of gorgeous columns on th’ unburthen’d air,
          Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
          Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,
          And nursled the young mountain in its lair.
          *Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall
          Thro’ the ebon air, besilvering the pall
          Of their own dissolution, while they die--
          Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.
          A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,
          Sat gently on these columns as a crown--
          A window of one circular diamond, there,
          Look’d out above into the purple air,

     * Some star which, from the ruin’d roof Of shak’d Olympus,
     by mischance, did fall.--_Milton._

          And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
          And hallow’d all the beauty twice again,
          Save when, between th’ Empyrean and that ring,
          Some eager spirit flapp’d his dusky wing.
          But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
          The dimness of this world:  that greyish green
          That Nature loves the best for Beauty’s grave
          Lurk’d in each cornice, round each architrave--
          And every sculptur’d cherub thereabout
          That from his marble dwelling peeréd out
          Seem’d earthly in the shadow of his niche--
          Achaian statues in a world so rich?
          *Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis--
          From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss
          **Of beautiful Gomorrah!  O, the wave
          Is now upon thee--but too late to save!

          Sound loves to revel in a summer night:
          Witness the murmur of the grey twilight

     * Voltaire, in speaking of Persepolis, says, “Je connois
     bien l’admiration qu’inspirent ces ruines--mais un palais
     erigé au pied d’une chaine des rochers sterils--peut il
     être un chef d’œvure des arts!” [_Voila les arguments de M.
     Voltaire_.]

     † “Oh! the wave”--Ula Degusi is the Turkish appellation;
     but, on its own shores, it is called Bahar Loth, or
     Almotanah. There were undoubtedly more than two cities
     engluphed in the “dead sea.” In the valley of Siddim were
     five--Adrah, Zeboin, Zoar, Sodom and Gomorrah. Stephen of
     Byzantium mentions eight, and Strabo thirteeen, (engulphed)
    --but the last is out of all reason.

    It is said, (Tacitus, Strabo, Josephus, Daniel of St. Saba, Nau,
Maundrell, Troilo, D’Arvieux) that after an excessive drought, the
vestiges of columns, walls, &c. are seen above the surface. At _any_
season, such remains may be discovered by looking down into the
transparent lake, and at such distances as would argue the existence of
many settlements in the space now usurped by the ‘Asphaltites.’

          *That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco,
          Of many a wild star-gazer long ago--
          That stealeth ever on the ear of him
          Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim.
          And sees the darkness coming as a cloud--
          ***Is not its form--its voice--most palpable and loud?

              But what is this?--it cometh--and it brings
          A music with it--‘tis the rush of wings--
          A pause--and then a sweeping, falling strain
          And Nesace is in her halls again.
          From the wild energy of wanton haste
              Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;
          And zone that clung around her gentle waist
              Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.
          Within the centre of that hall to breathe
          She paus’d and panted, Zanthe!  all beneath,
          The fairy light that kiss’d her golden hair
          And long’d to rest, yet could but sparkle there!

              ***Young flowers were whispering in melody
          To happy flowers that night--and tree to tree;
          Fountains were gushing music as they fell
          In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell;
          Yet silence came upon material things--
          Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings--
          And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
          Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:

     * Eyraco--Chaldea.

     ** I have often thought I could distinctly hear the sound of
     the darkness as it stole over the horizon.

     *** Fairies use flowers for their charactery.--_Merry Wives
     of Windsor_.  [William Shakespeare]

           “‘Neath blue-bell or streamer--
               Or tufted wild spray
           That keeps, from the dreamer,
               *The moonbeam away--
             Bright beings!  that ponder,
               With half closing eyes,
           On the stars which your wonder
               Hath drawn from the skies,
           Till they glance thro’ the shade, and
               Come down to your brow
           Like--eyes of the maiden
               Who calls on you now--
           Arise!  from your dreaming
               In violet bowers,
           To duty beseeming
               These star-litten hours--
           And shake from your tresses
               Encumber’d with dew
           The breath of those kisses
               That cumber them too--
           (O!  how, without you, Love!
               Could angels be blest?)
           Those kisses of true love
               That lull’d ye to rest!
           Up!--shake from your wing
               Each hindering thing:
           The dew of the night--
               It would weigh down your flight;
           And true love caresses--
               O! leave them apart!

     * In Scripture is this passage--“The sun shall not harm
     thee by day, nor the moon by night.” It is perhaps not
     generally known that the moon, in Egypt, has the effect of
     producing blindness to those who sleep with the face exposed
     to its rays, to which circumstance the passage evidently
     alludes.

          They are light on the tresses,
              But lead on the heart.

          Ligeia!  Ligeia!
              My beautiful one!
          Whose harshest idea
              Will to melody run,
          O!  is it thy will
              On the breezes to toss?
          Or, capriciously still,
              *Like the lone Albatross,
          Incumbent on night
              (As she on the air)
          To keep watch with delight
              On the harmony there?

          Ligeia!  whatever
              Thy image may be,
          No magic shall sever
              Thy music from thee.
          Thou hast bound many eyes
              In a dreamy sleep--
          But the strains still arise
              Which _thy_ vigilance keep--
          The sound of the rain
              Which leaps down to the flower,
          And dances again
              In the rhythm of the shower--
          †The murmur that springs
              From the growing of grass

     * The Albatross is said to sleep on the wing.

     ** I met with this idea in an old English tale, which I am
     now unable to obtain and quote from memory:--“The verie
     essence and, as it were, springe-heade, and origine of all
     musiche is the verie pleasaunte sounde which the trees of
     the forest do make when they growe.”

          Are the music of things--
              But are modell’d, alas!--
          Away, then my dearest,
              O!  hie thee away
          To springs that lie clearest
              Beneath the moon-ray--
           To lone lake that smiles,
              In its dream of deep rest,
          At the many star-isles
              That enjewel its breast--
          Where wild flowers, creeping,
              Have mingled their shade,
          On its margin is sleeping
              Full many a maid--
          Some have left the cool glade, and
              * Have slept with the bee--
          Arouse them my maiden,
              On moorland and lea--
          Go!  breathe on their slumber,
              All softly in ear,
          The musical number
              They slumber’d to hear--
          For what can awaken
              An angel so soon

     * The wild bee will not sleep in the shade if there be
     moonlight. The rhyme in this verse, as in one about sixty
     lines before, has an appearance of affectation. It is,
     however, imitated from Sir W. Scott, or rather from Claud
     Halcro--in whose mouth I admired its effect:

                O!  were there an island,
                    Tho’ ever so wild
                Where woman might smile, and
                    No man be beguil’d, &c.

          Whose sleep hath been taken
              Beneath the cold moon,
          As the spell which no slumber
              Of witchery may test,
          The rythmical number
              Which lull’d him to rest?”

          Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,
          A thousand seraphs burst th’ Empyrean thro’,
          Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight--
          Seraphs in all but “Knowledge,” the keen light
          That fell, refracted, thro’ thy bounds, afar
          O Death!  from eye of God upon that star:
          Sweet was that error--sweeter still that death--
          Sweet was that error--ev’n with _us_ the breath
          Of science dims the mirror of our joy--
          To them ‘twere the Simoom, and would destroy--
          For what (to them) availeth it to know
          That Truth is Falsehood--or that Bliss is Woe?
          Sweet was their death--with them to die was rife
          With the last ecstacy of satiate life--
          Beyond that death no immortality--
          But sleep that pondereth and is not “to be”--
          And there--oh!  may my weary spirit dwell--
          *Apart from Heaven’s Eternity--and yet how far from Hell!

     * With the Arabians there is a medium between Heaven and
     Hell, where men suffer no punishment, but yet do not attain
     that tranquil and even happiness which they suppose to be
     characteristic of heavenly enjoyment.

            Un no rompido sueno--
            Un dia puro--allegre--libre
            Quiera--
            Libre de amor--de zelo--
            De odio--de esperanza--de rezelo.---_Luis Ponce de Leon_.

     Sorrow is not excluded from “Al Aaraaf,” but it is that
     sorrow which the living love to cherish for the dead, and
     which, in some minds, resembles the delirium of opium. The
     passionate excitement of Love and the buoyancy of spirit
     attendant upon intoxication are its less holy pleasures--
     the price of which, to those souls who make choice of “Al
     Aaraaf” as their residence after life, is final death and
     annihilation.

          What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim,
          Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
          But two:  they fell:  for Heaven no grace imparts
          To those who hear not for their beating hearts.
          A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover--
          O!  where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)
          Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?

     *Unguided Love hath fallen--‘mid “tears of perfect moan.”

          He was a goodly spirit--he who fell:
          A wanderer by moss-y-mantled well--
          A gazer on the lights that shine above--
          A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
          What wonder?  For each star is eye-like there,
          And looks so sweetly down on Beauty’s hair--
          And they, and ev’ry mossy spring were holy
          To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.
          The night had found (to him a night of wo)
          Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo--
          Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
          And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.
          Here sate he with his love--his dark eye bent
          With eagle gaze along the firmament:
          Now turn’d it upon her--but ever then
          It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.

          “Iante, dearest, see!  how dim that ray!
          How lovely ‘tis to look so far away!

     * There be tears of perfect moan
         Wept for thee in Helicon.--_Milton._

          She seem’d not thus upon that autumn eve
          I left her gorgeous halls--nor mourn’d to leave.
          That eve--that eve--I should remember well--
          The sun-ray dropp’d, in Lemnos, with a spell
          On th’Arabesque carving of a gilded hall
          Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall--
          And on my eye-lids--O the heavy light!
          How drowsily it weigh’d them into night!
          On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran
          With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:
          But O that light!--I slumber’d--Death, the while,
          Stole o’er my senses in that lovely isle
          So softly that no single silken hair
          Awoke that slept--or knew that it was there.

          The last spot of Earth’s orb I trod upon
          *Was a proud temple call’d the Parthenon--
          More beauty clung around her column’d wall
          **Than ev’n thy glowing bosom beats withal,
          And when old Time my wing did disenthral
          Thence sprang I--as the eagle from his tower,
          And years I left behind me in an hour.
          What time upon her airy bounds I hung
          One half the garden of her globe was flung
          Unrolling as a chart unto my view--
          Tenantless cities of the desert too!
          Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,
          And half I wish’d to be again of men.”

          “My Angelo! and why of them to be?
          A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee--

    * It was entire in 1687--the most elevated spot in Athens.

    ** Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows
       Than have the white breasts of the Queen of Love.--_Marlowe._

           And greener fields than in yon world above,
           And women’s loveliness--and passionate love.”

           “But, list, Ianthe! when the air so soft
           *Fail’d, as my pennon’d spirit leapt aloft,
           Perhaps my brain grew dizzy--but the world
           I left so late was into chaos hurl’d--
           Sprang from her station, on the winds apart,
           And roll’d, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.
           Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar
           And fell--not swiftly as I rose before,
           But with a downward, tremulous motion thro’
           Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!
           Nor long the measure of my falling hours,
           For nearest of all stars was thine to ours--
           Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,
           A red Dædalion on the timid Earth.

           “We came--and to thy Earth--but not to us
           Be given our lady’s bidding to discuss:
           We came, my love; around, above, below,
           Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,
           Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod
           She grants to us, as granted by her God--
           But, Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurl’d
           Never his fairy wing o’er fairier world!
           Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes
           Alone could see the phantom in the skies,
           When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
           Headlong thitherward o’er the starry sea--
           But when its glory swell’d upon the sky,
           As glowing Beauty’s bust beneath man’s eye,

     * Pennon--for pinion.--_Milton_.

           We paus’d before the heritage of men,
           And thy star trembled--as doth Beauty then!”

           Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away
           The night that waned and waned and brought no day.
           They fell:  for Heaven to them no hope imparts
           Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.




TAMERLANE

     KIND solace in a dying hour!
         Such, father, is not (now) my theme--
     I will not madly deem that power
             Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
             Unearthly pride hath revell’d in--
         I have no time to dote or dream:
     You call it hope--that fire of fire!
     It is but agony of desire:
     If I _can_ hope--Oh God! I can--
         Its fount is holier--more divine--
     I would not call thee fool, old man,
         But such is not a gift of thine.

     Know thou the secret of a spirit
         Bow’d from its wild pride into shame.
     O! yearning heart! I did inherit
         Thy withering portion with the fame,
     The searing glory which hath shone
     Amid the jewels of my throne,
     Halo of Hell! and with a pain
     Not Hell shall make me fear again--
     O! craving heart, for the lost flowers
     And sunshine of my summer hours!
     Th’ undying voice of that dead time,
     With its interminable chime,
     Rings, in the spirit of a spell,
     Upon thy emptiness--a knell.

     I have not always been as now:
     The fever’d diadem on my brow
         I claim’d and won usurpingly--
     Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
         Rome to the Caesar--this to me?
             The heritage of a kingly mind,
     And a proud spirit which hath striven
             Triumphantly with human kind.

     On mountain soil I first drew life:
         The mists of the Taglay have shed
         Nightly their dews upon my head,
     And, I believe, the winged strife
     And tumult of the headlong air
     Have nestled in my very hair.

     So late from Heaven--that dew--it fell
         (Mid dreams of an unholy night)
     Upon me--with the touch of Hell,
         While the red flashing of the light
     From clouds that hung, like banners, o’er,
         Appeared to my half-closing eye
         The pageantry of monarchy,
     And the deep trumpet-thunder’s roar
         Came hurriedly upon me, telling
             Of human battle, where my voice,
         My own voice, silly child!--was swelling
             (O! how my spirit would rejoice,
     And leap within me at the cry)
     The battle-cry of Victory!

     The rain came down upon my head
         Unshelter’d--and the heavy wind
         Was giantlike--so thou, my mind!--
     It was but man, I thought, who shed
         Laurels upon me: and the rush--
     The torrent of the chilly air
     Gurgled within my ear the crush
         Of empires--with the captive’s prayer--
     The hum of suiters--and the tone
     Of flattery ‘round a sovereign’s throne.

     My passions, from that hapless hour,
         Usurp’d a tyranny which men
     Have deem’d, since I have reach’d to power;
             My innate nature--be it so:
         But, father, there liv’d one who, then,
     Then--in my boyhood--when their fire
             Burn’d with a still intenser glow,
     (For passion must, with youth, expire)
         E’en _then_ who knew this iron heart
         In woman’s weakness had a part.

     I have no words--alas!--to tell
     The loveliness of loving well!
     Nor would I now attempt to trace
     The more than beauty of a face
     Whose lineaments, upon my mind,
     Are--shadows on th’ unstable wind:
     Thus I remember having dwelt
     Some page of early lore upon,
     With loitering eye, till I have felt
     The letters--with their meaning--melt
     To fantasies--with none.

     O, she was worthy of all love!
     Love--as in infancy was mine--
     ‘Twas such as angel minds above
     Might envy; her young heart the shrine
     On which my ev’ry hope and thought
         Were incense--then a goodly gift,
             For they were childish--and upright--
     Pure--as her young example taught:
         Why did I leave it, and, adrift,
             Trust to the fire within, for light?

     We grew in age--and love--together,
         Roaming the forest, and the wild;
     My breast her shield in wintry weather--
         And, when the friendly sunshine smil’d,
     And she would mark the opening skies,
     _I_ saw no Heaven--but in her eyes.

     Young Love’s first lesson is--the heart:
         For ‘mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
     When, from our little cares apart,
         And laughing at her girlish wiles,
     I’d throw me on her throbbing breast,
         And pour my spirit out in tears--
     There was no need to speak the rest--
         No need to quiet any fears
     Of her--who ask’d no reason why,
     But turn’d on me her quiet eye!

     Yet _more_ than worthy of the love
     My spirit struggled with, and strove,
     When, on the mountain peak, alone,
     Ambition lent it a new tone--
     I had no being--but in thee:
         The world, and all it did contain
     In the earth--the air--the sea--
         Its joy--its little lot of pain
     That was new pleasure--the ideal,
         Dim, vanities of dreams by night--
     And dimmer nothings which were real--
         (Shadows--and a more shadowy light!)
     Parted upon their misty wings,
             And, so, confusedly, became
             Thine image, and--a name--a name!
     Two separate--yet most intimate things.

     I was ambitious--have you known
             The passion, father? You have not:
     A cottager, I mark’d a throne
     Of half the world as all my own,
             And murmur’d at such lowly lot--
     But, just like any other dream,
             Upon the vapour of the dew
     My own had past, did not the beam
             Of beauty which did while it thro’
     The minute--the hour--the day--oppress
     My mind with double loveliness.

     We walk’d together on the crown
     Of a high mountain which look’d down
     Afar from its proud natural towers
         Of rock and forest, on the hills--
     The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers
         And shouting with a thousand rills.

     I spoke to her of power and pride,
         But mystically--in such guise
     That she might deem it nought beside
         The moment’s converse; in her eyes
     I read, perhaps too carelessly--
         A mingled feeling with my own--
     The flush on her bright cheek, to me
         Seem’d to become a queenly throne
     Too well that I should let it be
         Light in the wilderness alone.

     I wrapp’d myself in grandeur then,
         And donn’d a visionary crown--
             Yet it was not that Fantasy
             Had thrown her mantle over me--
     But that, among the rabble--men,
             Lion ambition is chain’d down--
     And crouches to a keeper’s hand--
     Not so in deserts where the grand
     The wild--the terrible conspire
     With their own breath to fan his fire.

     Look ‘round thee now on Samarcand!--
         Is not she queen of Earth? her pride
     Above all cities? in her hand
         Their destinies? in all beside
     Of glory which the world hath known
     Stands she not nobly and alone?
     Falling--her veriest stepping-stone
     Shall form the pedestal of a throne--
     And who her sovereign? Timour--he
         Whom the astonished people saw
     Striding o’er empires haughtily
         A diadem’d outlaw--

     O! human love! thou spirit given,
     On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!
     Which fall’st into the soul like rain
     Upon the Siroc wither’d plain,
     And failing in thy power to bless
     But leav’st the heart a wilderness!
     Idea! which bindest life around
     With music of so strange a sound
     And beauty of so wild a birth--
     Farewell! for I have won the Earth!

     When Hope, the eagle that tower’d, could see
         No cliff beyond him in the sky,
     His pinions were bent droopingly--
         And homeward turn’d his soften’d eye.
     ‘Twas sunset: when the sun will part
     There comes a sullenness of heart
     To him who still would look upon
     The glory of the summer sun.
     That soul will hate the ev’ning mist,
     So often lovely, and will list
     To the sound of the coming darkness (known
     To those whose spirits hearken) as one
     Who, in a dream of night, _would_ fly
     But _cannot_ from a danger nigh.

     What tho’ the moon--the white moon
     Shed all the splendour of her noon,
     Her smile is chilly--and her beam,
     In that time of dreariness, will seem
     (So like you gather in your breath)
     A portrait taken after death.
     And boyhood is a summer sun
     Whose waning is the dreariest one--
     For all we live to know is known,
     And all we seek to keep hath flown--
     Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall
     With the noon-day beauty--which is all.

     I reach’d my home--my home no more--
         For all had flown who made it so--
     I pass’d from out its mossy door,
         And, tho’ my tread was soft and low,
     A voice came from the threshold stone
     Of one whom I had earlier known--
         O! I defy thee, Hell, to show
         On beds of fire that burn below,
         A humbler heart--a deeper wo--

     Father, I firmly do believe--
         I _know_--for Death, who comes for me
             From regions of the blest afar,
     Where there is nothing to deceive,
             Hath left his iron gate ajar,
         And rays of truth you cannot see
         Are flashing thro’ Eternity--
     I do believe that Eblis hath
     A snare in ev’ry human path--
     Else how, when in the holy grove
     I wandered of the idol, Love,
     Who daily scents his snowy wings
     With incense of burnt offerings
     From the most unpolluted things,
     Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
     Above with trelliced rays from Heaven
     No mote may shun--no tiniest fly
     The light’ning of his eagle eye--
     How was it that Ambition crept,
         Unseen, amid the revels there,
     Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
         In the tangles of Love’s very hair?

1829.




TO HELEN

     HELEN, thy beauty is to me
         Like those Nicean barks of yore,
     That gently, o’er a perfumed sea,
         The weary way-worn wanderer bore
         To his own native shore.

     On desperate seas long wont to roam,
         Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
     Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
         To the glory that was Greece,
     And the grandeur that was Rome.

     Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
         How statue-like I me thee stand,
     The agate lamp within thy hand!
         Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
         Are Holy-land!

1831.




THE VALLEY OF UNREST

     _Once_ it smiled a silent dell
     Where the people did not dwell;
     They had gone unto the wars,
     Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
     Nightly, from their azure towers,
     To keep watch above the flowers,
     In the midst of which all day
     The red sun-light lazily lay.
     _Now_ each visiter shall confess
     The sad valley’s restlessness.
     Nothing there is motionless--
     Nothing save the airs that brood
     Over the magic solitude.
     Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
     That palpitate like the chill seas
     Around the misty Hebrides!
     Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
     That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
     Uneasily, from morn till even,
     Over the violets there that lie
     In myriad types of the human eye--
     Over the lilies there that wave
     And weep above a nameless grave!
     They wave:--from out their fragrant tops
     Eternal dews come down in drops.
     They weep:--from off their delicate stems
     Perennial tears descend in gems.

1831.




ISRAFEL*

     IN Heaven a spirit doth dwell
         “Whose heart-strings are a lute;”
      None sing so wildly well
     As the angel Israfel,
     And the giddy stars (so legends tell)
     Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
         Of his voice, all mute.

     Tottering above
         In her highest noon
         The enamoured moon
     Blushes with love,
         While, to listen, the red levin
         (With the rapid Pleiads, even,
         Which were seven,)
         Pauses in Heaven

     And they say (the starry choir
         And all the listening things)
     That Israfeli’s fire
     Is owing to that lyre
         By which he sits and sings--
     The trembling living wire
     Of those unusual strings.

  * And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lut, and
  who has the sweetest voice of all God’s creatures.--KORAN.

     But the skies that angel trod,
         Where deep thoughts are a duty--
     Where Love’s a grown up God--
         Where the Houri glances are
     Imbued with all the beauty
         Which we worship in a star.

     Therefore, thou art not wrong,
         Israfeli, who despisest
     An unimpassion’d song:
     To thee the laurels belong
         Best bard, because the wisest!
     Merrily live, and long!

     The extacies above
         With thy burning measures suit--
     Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
         With the fervor of thy lute--
         Well may the stars be mute!

     Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
         Is a world of sweets and sours;
         Our flowers are merely--flowers,
     And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
         Is the sunshine of ours.

     If I could dwell
     Where Israfel
         Hath dwelt, and he where I,
     He might not sing so wildly well
         A mortal melody,
     While a bolder note than this might swell
         From my lyre within the sky.

1836.




TO ----

                     1

     The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see
         The wantonest singing birds
     Are lips--and all thy melody
         Of lip-begotten words--

                      2

     Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrin’d
         Then desolately fall,
     O! God! on my funereal mind
         Like starlight on a pall--

                       3

     Thy heart--_thy_ heart!--I wake and sigh,
         And sleep to dream till day
     Of truth that gold can never buy--
         Of the trifles that it may.

1829.




TO ----

     I HEED not that my earthly lot

         Hath-little of Earth in it--

     That years of love have been forgot

     In the hatred of a minute:--

     I mourn not that the desolate

         Are happier, sweet, than I,

     But that you sorrow for my fate

     Who am a passer-by.

1829.




TO THE RIVER----

     FAIR river! in thy bright, clear flow
         Of crystal, wandering water,
     Thou art an emblem of the glow
             Of beauty--the unhidden heart--
             The playful maziness of art
     In old Alberto’s daughter;

     But when within thy wave she looks--
             Which glistens then, and trembles--
     Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
             Her worshipper resembles;
     For in my heart, as in thy stream,
         Her image deeply lies--
     His heart which trembles at the beam
         Of her soul-searching eyes.

1829.




SONG

     I SAW thee on thy bridal day--
         When a burning blush came o’er thee,
     Though happiness around thee lay,
         The world all love before thee:

     And in thine eye a kindling light
         (Whatever it might be)
     Was all on Earth my aching sight
        Of Loveliness could see.

     That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame--
         As such it well may pass--
     Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
         In the breast of him, alas!

     Who saw thee on that bridal day,
         When that deep blush _would_ come o’er thee,
     Though happiness around thee lay,
         The world all love before thee.

1827.




SPIRITS OF THE DEAD

                                 1

     Thy soul shall find itself alone
     ‘Mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone--
     Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
     Into thine hour of secrecy:

                                 2

     Be silent in that solitude
         Which is not loneliness--for then
     The spirits of the dead who stood
         In life before thee are again
     In death around thee--and their will
     Shall then overshadow thee: be still.

                                3

     For the night--tho’ clear--shall frown--
     And the stars shall look not down,
     From their high thrones in the Heaven,
     With light like Hope to mortals given--
     But their red orbs, without beam,
     To thy weariness shall seem
     As a burning and a fever
     Which would cling to thee for ever:

                               4

     Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish--
     Now are visions ne’er to vanish--
     From thy spirit shall they pass
     No more--like dew-drop from the grass:

                              5

     The breeze--the breath of God--is still--
     And the mist upon the hill
     Shadowy--shadowy--yet unbroken,
     Is a symbol and a token--
     How it hangs upon the trees,
     A mystery of mysteries!--

1827.




A DREAM

     In visions of the dark night
         I have dreamed of joy departed--
     But a waking dreams of life and light
         Hath left me broken-hearted.

     Ah! what is not a dream by day
         To him whose eyes are cast
     On things around him with a ray
         Turned back upon the past?

     That holy dream--that holy dream,
         While all the world were chiding,
     Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
         A lonely spirit guiding.

     What though that light, thro’ storm and night,
         So trembled from afar-
     What could there be more purely bright
         In Truths day-star?

1827.




ROMANCE

     ROMANCE, who loves to nod and sing,
     With drowsy head and folded wing,
     Among the green leaves as they shake
     Far down within some shadowy lake,
     To me a painted paroquet
     Hath been--a most familiar bird--
     Taught me my alphabet to say--
     To lisp my very earliest word
     While in the wild wood I did lie,
     A child--with a most knowing eye.

     Of late, eternal Condor years
     So shake the very Heaven on high
     With tumult as they thunder by,
     I have no time for idle cares
     Through gazing on the unquiet sky.
     And when an hour with calmer wings
     Its down upon thy spirit flings--
     That little time with lyre and rhyme
     To while away--forbidden things!
     My heart would feel to be a crime
     Unless it trembled with the strings.

     1829.




FAIRY-LAND

     DIM vales--and shadowy floods--
     And cloudy-looking woods,
     Whose forms we can’t discover
     For the tears that drip all over
     Huge moons there wax and wane--
     Again--again--again--
     Every moment of the night--
     Forever changing places--
     And they put out the star-light
     With the breath from their pale faces.
     About twelve by the moon-dial
     One, more filmy than the rest
     (A kind which, upon trial,
     They have found to be the best)
     Comes down--still down--and down
     With its centre on the crown
     Of a mountain’s eminence,
     While its wide circumference
     In easy drapery falls
     Over hamlets, over halls,
     Wherever they may be--
     O’er the strange woods--o’er the sea--
     Over spirits on the wing--
     Over every drowsy thing--
     And buries them up quite
     In a labyrinth of light--
     And then, how deep!--O, deep!
     Is the passion of their sleep.
     In the morning they arise,
     And their moony covering
     Is soaring in the skies,
     With the tempests as they toss,
     Like--almost any thing--
     Or a yellow Albatross.
     They use that moon no more
     For the same end as before--
     Videlicet a tent--
     Which I think extravagant:
     Its atomies, however,
     Into a shower dissever,
     Of which those butterflies,
     Of Earth, who seek the skies,
     And so come down again
     (Never-contented things!)
     Have brought a specimen
     Upon their quivering wings.

     1831.




THE LAKE ---- TO----

     IN spring of youth it was my lot
     To haunt of the wide earth a spot
     The which I could not love the less--
     So lovely was the loneliness
     Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,
     And the tall pines that tower’d around.

     But when the Night had thrown her pall
     Upon that spot, as upon all,
     And the mystic wind went by
     Murmuring in melody--
     Then--ah then I would awake
     To the terror of the lone lake.

     Yet that terror was not fright,
     But a tremulous delight--
     A feeling not the jewelled mine
     Could teach or bribe me to define--
     Nor Love--although the Love were thine.

     Death was in that poisonous wave,
     And in its gulf a fitting grave
     For him who thence could solace bring
     To his lone imagining--
     Whose solitary soul could make
     An Eden of that dim lake.

     1827.




EVENING STAR

     ‘TWAS noontide of summer,
        And midtime of night,
     And stars, in their orbits,
        Shone pale, through the light
     Of the brighter, cold moon.
        ‘Mid planets her slaves,
     Herself in the Heavens,
        Her beam on the waves.

        I gazed awhile
        On her cold smile;
     Too cold-too cold for me--
        There passed, as a shroud,
        A fleecy cloud,
     And I turned away to thee,

        Proud Evening Star,
        In thy glory afar
     And dearer thy beam shall be;
        For joy to my heart
        Is the proud part
     Thou bearest in Heaven at night.,
        And more I admire
        Thy distant fire,
     Than that colder, lowly light.

     1827.




“THE HAPPIEST DAY.”

     I

     THE happiest day-the happiest hour
     My seared and blighted heart hath known,
     The highest hope of pride and power,
     I feel hath flown.

     Of power! said I? Yes! such I ween
     But they have vanished long, alas!
     The visions of my youth have been
     But let them pass.

     III

     And pride, what have I now with thee?
     Another brow may ev’n inherit
     The venom thou hast poured on me
     Be still my spirit!

     IV

     The happiest day-the happiest hour
     Mine eyes shall see-have ever seen
     The brightest glance of pride and power
     I feet have been:

     V

     But were that hope of pride and power
     Now offered with the pain
     Ev’n _then I _felt-that brightest hour
     I would not live again:

             VI

     For on its wing was dark alloy
     And as it fluttered-fell
     An essence-powerful to destroy
     A soul that knew it well.

     1827.




IMITATION

     A dark unfathom’d tide
     Of interminable pride--
     A mystery, and a dream,
     Should my early life seem;
     I say that dream was fraught
     With a wild, and waking thought
     Of beings that have been,
     Which my spirit hath not seen,
     Had I let them pass me by,
     With a dreaming eye!
     Let none of earth inherit
     That vision on my spirit;
     Those thoughts I would control
     As a spell upon his soul:
     For that bright hope at last
     And that light time have past,
     And my worldly rest hath gone
     With a sigh as it pass’d on
     I care not tho’ it perish
     With a thought I then did cherish.
     1827.






HYMN TO ARISTOGEITON AND HARMODIUS

Translation from the Greek

                I

     WREATHED in myrtle, my sword I’ll conceal
     Like those champions devoted and brave,
     When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,
     And to Athens deliverance gave.

                II

     Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam
     In the joy breathing isles of the blest;
     Where the mighty of old have their home
     Where Achilles and Diomed rest

                III

     In fresh myrtle my blade I’ll entwine,
     Like Harmodius, the gallant and good,
     When he made at the tutelar shrine
     A libation of Tyranny’s blood.

                IV

     Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!
     Ye avengers of Liberty’s wrongs!
     Endless ages shall cherish your fame,
     Embalmed in their echoing songs!

     1827.




DREAMS

     Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!
     My spirit not awak’ning, till the beam
     Of an Eternity should bring the morrow:
     Yes! tho’ that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,
     ‘Twere better than the dull reality
     Of waking life to him whose heart shall be,
     And hath been ever, on the chilly earth,
     A chaos of deep passion from his birth!

     But should it be--that dream eternally
     Continuing--as dreams have been to me
     In my young boyhood--should it thus be given,
     ‘Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven!
     For I have revell’d, when the sun was bright
     In the summer sky; in dreamy fields of light,
     And left unheedingly my very heart
     In climes of mine imagining--apart
     From mine own home, with beings that have been
     Of mine own thought--what more could I have seen?

     ‘Twas once & _only_ once & the wild hour
     From my rememberance shall not pass--some power
     Or spell had bound me--‘twas the chilly wind
     Came o’er me in the night & left behind
     Its image on my spirit, or the moon
     Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
     Too coldly--or the stars--howe’er it was
     That dream was as that night wind--let it pass.

     I have been happy--tho’ but in a dream
     I have been happy--& I love the theme--
     Dreams! in their vivid colouring of life--
     As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife
     Of semblance with reality which brings
     To the delirious eye more lovely things
     Of Paradise & Love--& all our own!
     Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.

         {From an earlier MS. Than in the book--ED.}




“IN YOUTH I HAVE KNOWN ONE”

     _How often we forget all time, when lone
     Admiring Nature’s universal throne;
     Her woods--her wilds--her mountains-the intense
     Reply of Hers to Our intelligence!_

                             I

     IN youth I have known one with whom the Earth
         In secret communing held-as he with it,
     In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth:
         Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit
     From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth
         A passionate light such for his spirit was fit
     And yet that spirit knew-not in the hour
         Of its own fervor-what had o’er it power.

                            II

     Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
         To a fever* by the moonbeam that hangs o’er,
     But I will half believe that wild light fraught
         With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
     Hath ever told-or is it of a thought
         The unembodied essence, and no more
     That with a quickening spell doth o’er us pass
         As dew of the night-time, o’er the summer grass?

                                   III

     Doth o’er us pass, when, as th’ expanding eye
         To the loved object-so the tear to the lid
     Will start, which lately slept in apathy?
         And yet it need not be--(that object) hid
     From us in life-but common-which doth lie
         Each hour before us--but then only bid
     With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken
         T’ awake us--‘Tis a symbol and a token

                               IV

     Of what in other worlds shall be--and given
         In beauty by our God, to those alone
     Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven
         Drawn by their heart’s passion, and that tone,
     That high tone of the spirit which hath striven
         Though not with Faith-with godliness--whose throne
     With desperate energy ‘t hath beaten down;
         Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.

          * Query “fervor”?--ED.



A PÆAN.

                         I.

     How shall the burial rite be read?
         The solemn song be sung?
     The requiem for the loveliest dead,
         That ever died so young?

                         II.

     Her friends are gazing on her,
         And on her gaudy bier,
     And weep!--oh! to dishonor
         Dead beauty with a tear!

                        III.

     They loved her for her wealth--
         And they hated her for her pride--
     But she grew in feeble health,
         And they _love_ her--that she died.

                       IV.

     They tell me (while they speak
         Of her “costly broider’d pall”)
     That my voice is growing weak--
         That I should not sing at all--

                        V.

     Or that my tone should be
         Tun’d to such solemn song
     So mournfully--so mournfully,
         That the dead may feel no wrong.

                       VI.

     But she is gone above,
         With young Hope at her side,
     And I am drunk with love
         Of the dead, who is my bride.--

                      VII.

     Of the dead--dead who lies
         All perfum’d there,
     With the death upon her eyes,
         And the life upon her hair.

                     VIII.

     Thus on the coffin loud and long
         I strike--the murmur sent
     Through the grey chambers to my song,
         Shall be the accompaniment.

                      IX.

     Thou died’st in thy life’s June--
         But thou did’st not die too fair:
     Thou did’st not die too soon,
         Nor with too calm an air.

                       X.

     From more than fiends on earth,
         Thy life and love are riven,
     To join the untainted mirth
         Of more than thrones in heaven--

                      XII.

     Therefore, to thee this night
         I will no requiem raise,
     But waft thee on thy flight,
         With a Pæan of old days.



NOTES

30. On the “Poems written in Youth” little comment is needed. This
section includes the pieces printed for first volume of 1827 (which was
subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second published
volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in their revised
versions, and a few others collected from various sources. “Al Aaraaf”
 first appeared, with the sonnet “To Silence” prefixed to it, in 1829,
and is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for
1831, however, this poem, its author’s longest, was introduced by the
following twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in--all subsequent
collections:

     AL AARAAF

     Mysterious star!
     Thou wert my dream
     All a long summer night--
     Be now my theme!
     By this clear stream,
     Of thee will I write;
     Meantime from afar
     Bathe me in light I

     Thy world has not the dross of ours,
     Yet all the beauty-all the flowers
     That list our love or deck our bowers
     In dreamy gardens, where do lie
     Dreamy maidens all the day;
     While the silver winds of Circassy
     On violet couches faint away.
     Little--oh “little dwells in thee”
      Like unto what on earth we see:
     Beauty’s eye is here the bluest
     In the falsest and untruest--On the sweetest
     air doth float
     The most sad and solemn note--

     If with thee be broken hearts,
     Joy so peacefully departs,
     That its echo still doth dwell,
     Like the murmur in the shell.
     Thou! thy truest type of grief
     Is the gently falling leaf!
     Thy framing is so holy
     Sorrow is not melancholy.

31. The earliest version of “Tamerlane” was included in the suppressed
volume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now
published. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and
improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the
lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at
least.

32. “To Helen” first appeared in the 1831 volume, as did also “The
Valley of Unrest” (as “The Valley Nis”), “Israfel,” and one or two
others of the youthful pieces. The poem styled “Romance,” constituted
the Preface of the 1829 volume, but with the addition of the following
lines:

     Succeeding years, too wild for song,
     Then rolled like tropic storms along,
     Where, through the garish lights that fly
     Dying along the troubled sky,
     Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,
     The blackness of the general Heaven,
     That very blackness yet doth Ring
     Light on the lightning’s silver wing.

     For being an idle boy lang syne;
     Who read Anacreon and drank wine,
     I early found Anacreon rhymes
     Were almost passionate sometimes--
     And by strange alchemy of brain
     His pleasures always turned to pain--
     His naiveté to wild desire--
     His wit to love-his wine to fire--
     And so, being young and dipt in folly,
     I fell in love with melancholy,

     And used to throw my earthly rest
     And quiet all away in jest--
     I could not love except where Death
     Was mingling his with Beauty’s breath--
     Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,
     Were stalking between her and me.

*****

     But now my soul hath too much room--
     Gone are the glory and the gloom--
     The black hath mellow’d into gray,
     And all the fires are fading away.

     My draught of passion hath been deep--
     I revell’d, and I now would sleep
     And after drunkenness of soul
     Succeeds the glories of the bowl
     An idle longing night and day
     To dream my very life away.

     But dreams--of those who dream as I,
     Aspiringly, are damned, and die:
     Yet should I swear I mean alone,
     By notes so very shrilly blown,
     To break upon Time’s monotone,
     While yet my vapid joy and grief
     Are tintless of the yellow leaf--
     Why not an imp the graybeard hath,
     Will shake his shadow in my path--
     And e’en the graybeard will o’erlook
     Connivingly my dreaming-book.




DOUBTFUL POEMS




ALONE

     From childhood’s hour I have not been
     As others were--I have not seen
     As others saw--I could not bring
     My passions from a common spring--
     From the same source I have not taken
     My sorrow--I could not awaken
     My heart to joy at the same tone--
     And all I lov’d--_I_ lov’d alone--
     _Then_--in my childhood--in the dawn
     Of a most stormy life--was drawn
     From ev’ry depth of good and ill
     The mystery which binds me still--
     From the torrent, or the fountain--
     From the red cliff of the mountain--
     From the sun that ‘round me roll’d
     In its autumn tint of gold--
     From the lightning in the sky
     As it pass’d me flying by--
     From the thunder, and the storm--
     And the cloud that took the form
     (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
     Of a demon in my view--


{This poem is no longer considered doubtful as it was in 1903. Liberty
has been taken to replace the book version with an earlier, perhaps more
original manuscript version--Ed}




TO ISADORE

             I

     BENEATH the vine-clad eaves,
         Whose shadows fall before
         Thy lowly cottage door
     Under the lilac’s tremulous leaves--
     Within thy snowy claspeèd hand
         The purple flowers it bore..
     Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand,
     Like queenly nymphs from Fairy-land--
     Enchantress of the flowery wand,
         Most beauteous Isadore!

              II

     And when I bade the dream
         Upon thy spirit flee,
         Thy violet eyes to me
     Upturned, did overflowing seem
     With the deep, untold delight
         Of Love’s serenity;
     Thy classic brow, like lilies white
     And pale as the Imperial Night
     Upon her throne, with stars bedight,
         Enthralled my soul to thee!

                 III

     Ah I ever I behold
         Thy dreamy, passionate eyes,
         Blue as the languid skies

     Hung with the sunset’s fringe of gold;
     Now strangely clear thine image grows,
         And olden memories
     Are startled from their long repose
     Like shadows on the silent snows
     When suddenly the night-wind blows
         Where quiet moonlight ties.

              IV

     Like music heard in dreams,
         Like strains of harps unknown,
         Of birds forever flown
     Audible as the voice of streams
     That murmur in some leafy dell,
         I hear thy gentlest tone,
     And Silence cometh with her spell
     Like that which on my tongue doth dwell,
     When tremulous in dreams I tell
         My love to thee alone!

              V

     In every valley heard,
         Floating from tree to tree,
         Less beautiful to, me,
     The music of the radiant bird,
     Than artless accents such as thine
         Whose echoes never flee!
     Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:--
     For uttered in thy tones benign
     (Enchantress!) this rude name of mine

         Doth seem a melody!




THE VILLAGE STREET

     IN these rapid, restless shadows,
         Once I walked at eventide,
     When a gentle, silent maiden,
         Wal    ked in beauty at my side
     She alone there walked beside me
         All in beauty, like a bride.

     Pallidly the moon was shining
         On the dewy meadows nigh;
     On the silvery, silent rivers,
         On the mountains far and high
     On the ocean’s star-lit waters,
         Where the winds a-weary die.

     Slowly, silently we wandered
     From the open cottage door,
     Underneath the elm’s long branches
     To the pavement bending o’er;
     Underneath the mossy willow
     And the dying sycamore.

     With the myriad stars in beauty
     All bedight, the heavens were seen,
     Radiant hopes were bright around me,
     Like the light of stars serene;
     Like the mellow midnight splendor
     Of the Night’s irradiate queen.

     Audibly the elm-leaves whispered
         Peaceful, pleasant melodies,
     Like the distant murmured music
         Of unquiet, lovely seas:
     While the winds were hushed in slumber
         In the fragrant flowers and trees.

     Wondrous and unwonted beauty
         Still adorning all did seem,
     While I told my love in fables
         ‘Neath the willows by the stream;
     Would the heart have kept unspoken
         Love that was its rarest dream!

     Instantly away we wandered
         In the shadowy twilight tide,
     She, the silent, scornful maiden,
         Walking calmly at my side,
     With a step serene and stately,
         All in beauty, all in pride.

     Vacantly I walked beside her.
         On the earth mine eyes were cast;
     Swift and keen there came unto me
         Ritter memories of the past
     On me, like the rain in Autumn
         On the dead leaves, cold and fast.

     Underneath the elms we parted,
         By the lowly cottage door;
     One brief word alone was uttered
         Never on our lips before;
     And away I walked forlornly,
         Broken-hearted evermore.

     Slowly, silently I loitered,
         Homeward, in the night, alone;
     Sudden anguish bound my spirit,
         That my youth had never known;
     Wild unrest, like that which cometh
         When the Night’s first dream hath flown.

     Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper
         Mad, discordant melodies,
     And keen melodies like shadows
         Haunt the moaning willow trees,
     And the sycamores with laughter
         Mock me in the nightly breeze.

     Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight
         Through the sighing foliage streams;
     And each morning, midnight shadow,
         Shadow of my sorrow seems;
     Strive, 0 heart, forget thine idol!
         And, 0 soul, forget thy dreams!




THE FOREST REVERIE

     ‘Tis said that when
     The hands of men
     Tamed this primeval wood,
     And hoary trees with groans of woe,
     Like warriors by an unknown foe,
     Were in their strength subdued,
     The virgin Earth Gave instant birth
     To springs that ne’er did flow
     That in the sun Did rivulets run,
     And all around rare flowers did blow
     The wild rose pale Perfumed the gale
     And the queenly lily adown the dale
     (Whom the sun and the dew
     And the winds did woo),
     With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.

     So when in tears
     The love of years
     Is wasted like the snow,
     And the fine fibrils of its life
     By the rude wrong of instant strife
     Are broken at a blow
     Within the heart
     Do springs upstart
     Of which it doth now know,
     And strange, sweet dreams,
     Like silent streams
     That from new fountains overflow,
     With the earlier tide
     Of rivers glide
     Deep in the heart whose hope has died--
     Quenching the fires its ashes hide,--
     Its ashes, whence will spring and grow
     Sweet flowers, ere long,
     The rare and radiant flowers of song!

     In placing before the public this collection of Edgar Poe's poetical
     works, it is requisite to point out in what respects it differs from,
     and is superior to, the numerous collections which have preceded it.
     Until recently, all editions, whether American or English, of Poe's
     poems have been 'verbatim' reprints of the first posthumous collection,
     published at New York in 1850.

     In 1874 I began drawing attention to the fact that unknown and
     unreprinted poetry by Edgar Poe was in existence. Most, if not all, of
     the specimens issued in my articles have since been reprinted by
     different editors and publishers, but the present is the first occasion
     on which all the pieces referred to have been garnered into one sheaf.
     Besides the poems thus alluded to, this volume will be found to contain
     many additional pieces and extra stanzas, nowhere else published or
     included in Poe's works. Such verses have been gathered from printed or
     manuscript sources during a research extending over many years.

     In addition to the new poetical matter included in this volume,
     attention should, also, be solicited on behalf of the notes, which will
     be found to contain much matter, interesting both from biographical and
     bibliographical points of view.

     MEMOIR OF EDGAR ALLAN POE.


     During the last few years every incident in the life of Edgar Poe has
     been subjected to microscopic investigation. The result has not been
     altogether satisfactory. On the one hand, envy and prejudice have
     magnified every blemish of his character into crime, whilst on the
     other, blind admiration would depict him as far "too good for human
     nature's daily food." Let us endeavor to judge him impartially, granting
     that he was as a mortal subject to the ordinary weaknesses of mortality,
     but that he was tempted sorely, treated badly, and suffered deeply.

     The poet's ancestry and parentage are chiefly interesting as explaining
     some of the complexities of his character. His father, David Poe, was of
     Anglo-Irish extraction. Educated for the Bar, he elected to abandon it
     for the stage. In one of his tours through the chief towns of the United
     States he met and married a young actress, Elizabeth Arnold, member of
     an English family distinguished for its musical talents. As an actress,
     Elizabeth Poe acquired some reputation, but became even better known for
     her domestic virtues. In those days the United States afforded little
     scope for dramatic energy, so it is not surprising to find that when her
     husband died, after a few years of married life, the young widow had a
     vain struggle to maintain herself and three little ones, William Henry,
     Edgar, and Rosalie. Before her premature death, in December, 1811, the
     poet's mother had been reduced to the dire necessity of living on the
     charity of her neighbors.

     Edgar, the second child of David and Elizabeth Poe, was born at Boston,
     in the United States, on the 19th of January, 1809. Upon his mother's
     death at Richmond, Virginia, Edgar was adopted by a wealthy Scotch
     merchant, John Allan. Mr. Allan, who had married an American lady and
     settled in Virginia, was childless. He therefore took naturally to the
     brilliant and beautiful little boy, treated him as his son, and made him
     take his own surname. Edgar Allan, as he was now styled, after some
     elementary tuition in Richmond, was taken to England by his adopted
     parents, and, in 1816, placed at the Manor House School,
     Stoke-Newington.

     Under the Rev. Dr. Bransby, the future poet spent a lustrum of his life
     neither unprofitably nor, apparently, ungenially. Dr. Bransby, who is
     himself so quaintly portrayed in Poe's tale of 'William Wilson',
     described "Edgar Allan," by which name only he knew the lad, as "a quick
     and clever boy," who "would have been a very good boy had he not been
     spoilt by his parents," meaning, of course, the Allans. They "allowed
     him an extravagant amount of pocket-money, which enabled him to get into
     all manner of mischief. Still I liked the boy," added the tutor, "but,
     poor fellow, his parents spoiled him."

     Poe has described some aspects of his school days in his oft cited story
     of 'William Wilson'. Probably there is the usual amount of poetic
     exaggeration in these reminiscences, but they are almost the only record
     we have of that portion of his career and, therefore, apart from their
     literary merits, are on that account deeply interesting. The description
     of the sleepy old London suburb, as it was in those days, is remarkably
     accurate, but the revisions which the story of 'William Wilson' went
     through before it reached its present perfect state caused many of the
     author's details to deviate widely from their original correctness. His
     schoolhouse in the earliest draft was truthfully described as an "old,
     irregular, and cottage-built" dwelling, and so it remained until its
     destruction a few years ago.

     The 'soi-disant' William Wilson, referring to those bygone happy days
     spent in the English academy, says,

       "The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident
       to occupy or amuse it. The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to
       bed; the connings, the recitations, the periodical half-holidays and
       perambulations, the playground, with its broils, its pastimes, its
       intrigues--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to
       involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, a
       universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and
       spirit-stirring, _'Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!'"_

     From this world of boyish imagination Poe was called to his adopted
     parents' home in the United States. He returned to America in 1821, and
     was speedily placed in an academy in Richmond, Virginia, in which city
     the Allans continued to reside. Already well grounded in the elementary
     processes of education, not without reputation on account of his
     European residence, handsome, proud, and regarded as the heir of a
     wealthy man, Poe must have been looked up to with no little respect by
     his fellow pupils. He speedily made himself a prominent position in the
     school, not only by his classical attainments, but by his athletic
     feats--accomplishments calculated to render him a leader among lads.

       "In the simple school athletics of those days, when a gymnasium had
       not been heard of, he was 'facile princeps',"

     is the reminiscence of his fellow pupil, Colonel T. L. Preston. Poe he
     remembers as

       "a swift runner, a wonderful leaper, and, what was more rare, a boxer,
       with some slight training.... He would allow the strongest boy in the
       school to strike him with full force in the chest. He taught me the
       secret, and I imitated him, after my measure. It was to inflate the
       lungs to the uttermost, and at the moment of receiving the blow to
       exhale the air. It looked surprising, and was, indeed, a little rough;
       but with a good breast-bone, and some resolution, it was not difficult
       to stand it. For swimming he was noted, being in many of his athletic
       proclivities surprisingly like Byron in his youth."

     In one of his feats Poe only came off second best.

       "A challenge to a foot race," says Colonel Preston, "had been passed
       between the two classical schools of the city; we selected Poe as our
       champion. The race came off one bright May morning at sunrise, in the
       Capitol Square. Historical truth compels me to add that on this
       occasion our school was beaten, and we had to pay up our small bets.
       Poe ran well, but his competitor was a long-legged, Indian-looking
       fellow, who would have outstripped Atalanta without the help of the
       golden apples."

       "In our Latin exercises in school," continues the colonel, "Poe was
       among the first--not first without dispute. We had competitors who
       fairly disputed the palm, especially one, Nat Howard, afterwards known
       as one of the ripest scholars in Virginia, and distinguished also as a
       profound lawyer. If Howard was less brilliant than Poe, he was far
       more studious; for even then the germs of waywardness were developing
       in the nascent poet, and even then no inconsiderable portion of his
       time was given to versifying. But if I put Howard as a Latinist on a
       level with Poe, I do him full justice."

       "Poe," says the colonel, "was very fond of the Odes of Horace, and
       repeated them so often in my hearing that I learned by sound the words
       of many before I understood their meaning. In the lilting rhythm of
       the Sapphics and Iambics, his ear, as yet untutored in more
       complicated harmonies, took special delight. Two odes, in particular,
       have been humming in my ear all my life since, set to the tune of his
       recitation:

         _'Jam satis terris nivis atque dirce
         Grandinis misit Pater, et rubente,'_

       And

         _'Non ebur neque aureum
         Mea renidet in dono lacu ar,_' etc.

       "I remember that Poe was also a very fine French scholar. Yet, with
       all his superiorities, he was not the master spirit nor even the
       favorite of the school. I assign, from my recollection, this place to
       Howard. Poe, as I recall my impressions now, was self-willed,
       capricious, inclined to be imperious, and, though of generous
       impulses, not steadily kind, nor even amiable; and so what he would
       exact was refused to him. I add another thing which had its influence,
       I am sure. At the time of which I speak, Richmond was one of the most
       aristocratic cities on this side of the Atlantic.... A school is, of
       its nature, democratic; but still boys will unconsciously bear about
       the odor of their fathers' notions, good or bad. Of Edgar Poe," who
       had then resumed his parental cognomen, "it was known that his parents
       had been players, and that he was dependent upon the bounty that is
       bestowed upon an adopted son. All this had the effect of making the
       boys decline his leadership; and, on looking back on it since, I fancy
       it gave him a fierceness he would otherwise not have had."

     This last paragraph of Colonel Preston's recollections cast a suggestive
     light upon the causes which rendered unhappy the lad's early life and
     tended to blight his prospective hopes. Although mixing with members of
     the best families of the province, and naturally endowed with hereditary
     and native pride,--fostered by the indulgence of wealth and the
     consciousness of intellectual superiority,--Edgar Poe was made to feel
     that his parentage was obscure, and that he himself was dependent upon
     the charity and caprice of an alien by blood. For many lads these things
     would have had but little meaning, but to one of Poe's proud temperament
     it must have been a source of constant torment, and all allusions to it
     gall and wormwood. And Mr. Allan was not the man to wean Poe from such
     festering fancies: as a rule he was proud of the handsome and talented
     boy, and indulged him in all that wealth could purchase, but at other
     times he treated him with contumely, and made him feel the bitterness of
     his position.

     Still Poe did maintain his leading position among the scholars at that
     Virginian academy, and several still living have favored us with
     reminiscences of him. His feats in swimming to which Colonel Preston has
     alluded, are quite a feature of his youthful career. Colonel Mayo
     records one daring performance in natation which is thoroughly
     characteristic of the lad. One day in mid-winter, when standing on the
     banks of the James River, Poe dared his comrade into jumping in, in
     order to swim to a certain point with him. After floundering about in
     the nearly frozen stream for some time, they reached the piles upon
     which Mayo's Bridge was then supported, and there attempted to rest and
     try to gain the shore by climbing up the log abutment to the bridge.
     Upon reaching the bridge, however, they were dismayed to find that its
     plank flooring overlapped the abutment by several feet, and that it was
     impossible to ascend it. Nothing remained for them but to let go their
     slippery hold and swim back to the shore. Poe reached the bank in an
     exhausted and benumbed condition, whilst Mayo was rescued by a boat just
     as he was succumbing. On getting ashore Poe was seized with a violent
     attack of vomiting, and both lads were ill for several weeks.

     Alluding to another quite famous swimming feat of his own, the poet
     remarked, "Any 'swimmer in the falls' in my days would have swum the
     Hellespont, and thought nothing of the matter. I swam from Ludlam's
     Wharf to Warwick (six miles), in a hot June sun, against one of the
     strongest tides ever known in the river. It would have been a feat
     comparatively easy to swim twenty miles in still water. I would not
     think much," Poe added in a strain of exaggeration not unusual with him,
     "of attempting to swim the British Channel from Dover to Calais."
     Colonel Mayo, who had tried to accompany him in this performance, had to
     stop on the way, and says that Poe, when he reached the goal, emerged
     from the water with neck, face, and back blistered. The facts of this
     feat, which was undertaken for a wager, having been questioned, Poe,
     ever intolerant of contradiction, obtained and published the affidavits
     of several gentlemen who had witnessed it. They also certified that Poe
     did not seem at all fatigued, and that he walked back to Richmond
     immediately after the performance.

     The poet is generally remembered at this part of his career to have been
     slight in figure and person, but to have been well made, active, sinewy,
     and graceful. Despite the fact that he was thus noted among his
     schoolfellows and indulged at home, he does not appear to have been in
     sympathy with his surroundings. Already dowered with the "hate of hate,
     the scorn of scorn," he appears to have made foes both among those who
     envied him and those whom, in the pride of intellectuality, he treated
     with pugnacious contempt. Beneath the haughty exterior, however, was a
     warm and passionate heart, which only needed circumstance to call forth
     an almost fanatical intensity of affection. A well-authenticated
     instance of this is thus related by Mrs. Whitman:

       "While at the academy in Richmond, he one day accompanied a schoolmate
       to his home, where he saw, for the first time, Mrs. Helen Stannard,
       the mother of his young friend. This lady, on entering the room, took
       his hands and spoke some gentle and gracious words of welcome, which
       so penetrated the sensitive heart of the orphan boy as to deprive him
       of the power of speech, and for a time almost of consciousness itself.
       He returned home in a dream, with but one thought, one hope in life
      --to hear again the sweet and gracious words that had made the
       desolate world so beautiful to him, and filled his lonely heart with
       the oppression of a new joy. This lady afterwards became the confidant
       of all his boyish sorrows, and hers was the one redeeming influence
       that saved and guided him in the earlier days of his turbulent and
       passionate youth."

     When Edgar was unhappy at home, which, says his aunt, Mrs. Clemm, "was
     very often the case, he went to Mrs. Stannard for sympathy, for
     consolation, and for advice." Unfortunately, the sad fortune which so
     frequently thwarted his hopes ended this friendship. The lady was
     overwhelmed by a terrible calamity, and at the period when her guiding
     voice was most requisite, she fell a prey to mental alienation. She
     died, and was entombed in a neighboring cemetery, but her poor boyish
     admirer could not endure to think of her lying lonely and forsaken in
     her vaulted home, so he would leave the house at night and visit her
     tomb. When the nights were drear, "when the autumnal rains fell, and the
     winds wailed mournfully over the graves, he lingered longest, and came
     away most regretfully."

     The memory of this lady, of this "one idolatrous and purely ideal love"
     of his boyhood, was cherished to the last. The name of Helen frequently
     recurs in his youthful verses, "The Pæan," now first included in his
     poetical works, refers to her; and to her he inscribed the classic and
     exquisitely beautiful stanzas beginning "Helen, thy beauty is to me."

     Another important item to be noted in this epoch of his life is that he
     was already a poet. Among his schoolfellows he appears to have acquired
     some little reputation as a writer of satirical verses; but of his
     poetry, of that which, as he declared, had been with him "not a purpose,
     but a passion," he probably preserved the secret, especially as we know
     that at his adoptive home poesy was a forbidden thing. As early as 1821
     he appears to have essayed various pieces, and some of these were
     ultimately included in his first volume. With Poe poetry was a personal
     matter--a channel through which the turbulent passions of his heart
     found an outlet. With feelings such as were his, it came to pass, as a
     matter of course, that the youthful poet fell in love. His first affair
     of the heart is, doubtless, reminiscently portrayed in what he says of
     his boyish ideal, Byron. This passion, he remarks, "if passion it can
     properly be called, was of the most thoroughly romantic, shadowy, and
     imaginative character. It was born of the hour, and of the youthful
     necessity to love. It had no peculiar regard to the person, or to the
     character, or to the reciprocating affection... Any maiden, not
     immediately and positively repulsive," he deems would have suited the
     occasion of frequent and unrestricted intercourse with such an
     imaginative and poetic youth. "The result," he deems, "was not merely
     natural, or merely probable; it was as inevitable as destiny itself."

     Between the lines may be read the history of his own love. "The Egeria
     of _his_ dreams--the Venus Aphrodite that sprang in full and supernal
     loveliness from the bright foam upon the storm-tormented ocean of _his_
     thoughts," was a little girl, Elmira Royster, who lived with her father
     in a house opposite to the Allans in Richmond. The young people met
     again and again, and the lady, who has only recently passed away,
     recalled Edgar as "a beautiful boy," passionately fond of music,
     enthusiastic and impulsive, but with prejudices already strongly
     developed. A certain amount of love-making took place between the young
     people, and Poe, with his usual passionate energy, ere he left home for
     the University had persuaded his fair inamorata to engage herself to
     him. Poe left home for the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, in
     the beginning of 1825. lie wrote frequently to Miss Royster, but her
     father did not approve of the affair, and, so the story runs,
     intercepted the correspondence, until it ceased. At seventeen, Elmira
     became the bride of a Mr. Shelton, and it was not until some time
     afterwards that Poe discovered how it was his passionate appeals had
     failed to elicit any response from the object of his youthful affection.

     Poe's short university career was in many respects a repetition of his
     course at the Richmond Academy. He became noted at Charlottesville both
     for his athletic feats and his scholastic successes. He entered as a
     student on February 1,1826, and remained till the close of the second
     session in December of that year.

       "He entered the schools of ancient and modern languages, attending the
       lectures on Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian. I was a member
       of the last three classes," says Mr. William Wertenbaker, the recently
       deceased librarian, "and can testify that he was tolerably regular in
       his attendance, and a successful student, having obtained distinction
       at the final examination in Latin and French, and this was at that
       time the highest honor a student could obtain. The present regulations
       in regard to degrees had not then been adopted. Under existing
       regulations, he would have graduated in the two languages above-named,
       and have been entitled to diplomas."

     These statements of Poe's classmate are confirmed by Dr. Harrison,
     chairman of the Faculty, who remarks that the poet was a great favorite
     with his fellow-students, and was noted for the remarkable rapidity with
     which he prepared his recitations and for their accuracy, his
     translations from the modern languages being especially noteworthy.

     Several of Poe's classmates at Charlottesville have testified to his
     "noble qualities" and other good endowments, but they remember that his
     "disposition was rather retiring, and that he had few intimate
     associates." Mr. Thomas Boiling, one of his fellow-students who has
     favored us with reminiscences of him, says:

       "I was 'acquainted', with him, but that is about all. My impression
       was, and is, that no one could say that he 'knew' him. He wore a
       melancholy face always, and even his smile--for I do not ever remember
       to have seen him laugh--seemed to be forced. When he engaged
       sometimes with others in athletic exercises, in which, so far as high
       or long jumping, I believe he excelled all the rest, Poe, with the
       same ever sad face, appeared to participate in what was amusement to
       the others more as a task than sport."

     Poe had no little talent for drawing, and Mr. John Willis states that
     the walls of his college rooms were covered with his crayon sketches,
     whilst Mr. Boiling mentions, in connection with the poet's artistic
     facility, some interesting incidents. The two young men had purchased
     copies of a handsomely-illustrated edition of Byron's poems, and upon
     visiting Poe a few days after this purchase, Mr. Bolling found him
     engaged in copying one of the engravings with crayon upon his dormitory
     ceiling. He continued to amuse himself in this way from time to time
     until he had filled all the space in his room with life-size figures
     which, it is remembered by those who saw them, were highly ornamental
     and well executed.


     As Mr. Bolling talked with his associate, Poe would continue to scribble
     away with his pencil, as if writing, and when his visitor jestingly
     remonstrated with him on his want of politeness, he replied that he had
     been all attention, and proved that he had by suitable comment,
     assigning as a reason for his apparent want of courtesy that he was
     trying 'to divide his mind,' to carry on a conversation and write
     sensibly upon a totally different subject at the same time.

     Mr. Wertenbaker, in his interesting reminiscences of the poet, says:

       "As librarian I had frequent official intercourse with Poe, but it was
       at or near the close of the session before I met him in the social
       circle. After spending an evening together at a private house he
       invited me, on our return, into his room. It was a cold night in
       December, and his fire having gone pretty nearly out, by the aid of
       some tallow candles, and the fragments of a small table which he broke
       up for the purpose, he soon rekindled it, and by its comfortable blaze
       I spent a very pleasant hour with him. On this occasion he spoke with
       regret of the large amount of money he had wasted, and of the debts he
       had contracted during the session. If my memory be not at fault, he
       estimated his indebtedness at $2,000 and, though they were gaming
       debts, he was earnest and emphatic in the declaration that he was
       bound by honor to pay them at the earliest opportunity."

     This appears to have been Poe's last night at the university. He left it
     never to return, yet, short as was his sojourn there, he left behind him
     such honorable memories that his 'alma mater' is now only too proud to
     enrol his name among her most respected sons. Poe's adopted father,
     however, did not regard his 'protégé's' collegiate career with equal
     pleasure: whatever view he may have entertained of the lad's scholastic
     successes, he resolutely refused to discharge the gambling debts which,
     like too many of his classmates, he had incurred. A violent altercation
     took place between Mr. Allan and the youth, and Poe hastily quitted the
     shelter of home to try and make his way in the world alone.

     Taking with him such poems as he had ready, Poe made his way to Boston,
     and there looked up some of his mother's old theatrical friends. Whether
     he thought of adopting the stage as a profession, or whether he thought
     of getting their assistance towards helping him to put a drama of his
     own upon the stage,--that dream of all young authors,--is now unknown.
     He appears to have wandered about for some time, and by some means or
     the other succeeded in getting a little volume of poems printed "for
     private circulation only." This was towards the end of 1827, when he was
     nearing nineteen. Doubtless Poe expected to dispose of his volume by
     subscription among his friends, but copies did not go off, and
     ultimately the book was suppressed, and the remainder of the edition,
     for "reasons of a private nature," destroyed.

     What happened to the young poet, and how he contrived to exist for the
     next year or so, is a mystery still unsolved. It has always been
     believed that he found his way to Europe and met with some curious
     adventures there, and Poe himself certainly alleged that such was the
     case. Numbers of mythical stories have been invented to account for this
     chasm in the poet's life, and most of them self-evidently fabulous. In a
     recent biography of Poe an attempt had been made to prove that he
     enlisted in the army under an assumed name, and served for about
     eighteen months in the artillery in a highly creditable manner,
     receiving an honorable discharge at the instance of Mr. Allan. This
     account is plausible, but will need further explanation of its many
     discrepancies of dates, and verification of the different documents
     cited in proof of it, before the public can receive it as fact. So many
     fables have been published about Poe, and even many fictitious documents
     quoted, that it behoves the unprejudiced to be wary in accepting any new
     statements concerning him that are not thoroughly authenticated.

     On the 28th February, 1829, Mrs. Allan died, and with her death the
     final thread that had bound Poe to her husband was broken. The adopted
     son arrived too late to take a last farewell of her whose influence had
     given the Allan residence its only claim upon the poet's heart. A kind
     of truce was patched up over the grave of the deceased lady, but, for
     the future, Poe found that home was home no longer.

     Again the young man turned to poetry, not only as a solace but as a
     means of earning a livelihood. Again he printed a little volume of
     poems, which included his longest piece, "Al Aaraaf," and several others
     now deemed classic. The book was a great advance upon his previous
     collection, but failed to obtain any amount of public praise or personal
     profit for its author.

     Feeling the difficulty of living by literature at the same time that he
     saw he might have to rely largely upon his own exertions for a
     livelihood, Poe expressed a wish to enter the army. After no little
     difficulty a cadetship was obtained for him at the West Point Military
     Academy, a military school in many respects equal to the best in Europe
     for the education of officers for the army. At the time Poe entered the
     Academy it possessed anything but an attractive character, the
     discipline having been of the most severe character, and the
     accommodation in many respects unsuitable for growing lads.

     The poet appears to have entered upon this new course of life with his
     usual enthusiasm, and for a time to have borne the rigid rules of the
     place with unusual steadiness. He entered the institution on the 1st
     July, 1830, and by the following March had been expelled for determined
     disobedience. Whatever view may be taken of Poe's conduct upon this
     occasion, it must be seen that the expulsion from West Point was of his
     own seeking. Highly-colored pictures have been drawn of his eccentric
     behavior at the Academy, but the fact remains that he wilfully, or at
     any rate purposely, flung away his cadetship. It is surmised with
     plausibility that the second marriage of Mr. Allan, and his expressed
     intention of withdrawing his help and of not endowing or bequeathing
     this adopted son any of his property, was the mainspring of Poe's
     action. Believing it impossible to continue without aid in a profession
     so expensive as was a military life, he determined to relinquish it and
     return to his long cherished attempt to become an author.

     Expelled from the institution that afforded board and shelter, and
     discarded by his former protector, the unfortunate and penniless young
     man yet a third time attempted to get a start in the world of letters by
     means of a volume of poetry. If it be true, as alleged, that several of
     his brother cadets aided his efforts by subscribing for his little work,
     there is some possibility that a few dollars rewarded this latest
     venture. Whatever may have resulted from the alleged aid, it is certain
     that in a short time after leaving the Military Academy Poe was reduced
     to sad straits. He disappeared for nearly two years from public notice,
     and how he lived during that period has never been satisfactorily
     explained. In 1833 he returns to history in the character of a winner of
     a hundred-dollar award offered by a newspaper for the best story.

     The prize was unanimously adjudged to Poe by the adjudicators, and Mr.
     Kennedy, an author of some little repute, having become interested by
     the young man's evident genius, generously assisted him towards
     obtaining a livelihood by literary labor. Through his new friend's
     introduction to the proprietor of the 'Southern Literary Messenger', a
     moribund magazine published at irregular intervals, Poe became first a
     paid contributor, and eventually the editor of the publication, which
     ultimately he rendered one of the most respected and profitable
     periodicals of the day. This success was entirely due to the brilliancy
     and power of Poe's own contributions to the magazine.

     In March, 1834, Mr. Allan died, and if our poet had maintained any hopes
     of further assistance from him, all doubt was settled by the will, by
     which the whole property of the deceased was left to his second wife and
     her three sons. Poe was not named.

     On the 6th May, 1836, Poe, who now had nothing but his pen to trust to,
     married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, a child of only fourteen, and with
     her mother as housekeeper, started a home of his own. In the meantime
     his various writings in the 'Messenger' began to attract attention and
     to extend his reputation into literary circles, but beyond his editorial
     salary of about $520 brought him no pecuniary reward.

     In January, 1837, for reasons never thoroughly explained, Poe severed
     his connection with the 'Messenger', and moved with all his household
     goods from Richmond to New York. Southern friends state that Poe was
     desirous of either being admitted into partnership with his employer, or
     of being allowed a larger share of the profits which his own labors
     procured. In New York his earnings seem to have been small and
     irregular, his most important work having been a republication from the
     'Messenger' in book form of his Defoe-like romance entitled 'Arthur
     Gordon Pym'. The truthful air of "The Narrative," as well as its other
     merits, excited public curiosity both in England and America; but Poe's
     remuneration does not appear to have been proportionate to its success,
     nor did he receive anything from the numerous European editions the work
     rapidly passed through.

     In 1838 Poe was induced by a literary friend to break up his New York
     home and remove with his wife and aunt (her mother) to Philadelphia. The
     Quaker city was at that time quite a hotbed for magazine projects, and
     among the many new periodicals Poe was enabled to earn some kind of a
     living. To Burton's 'Gentleman's Magazine' for 1837 he had contributed a
     few articles, but in 1840 he arranged with its proprietor to take up the
     editorship. Poe had long sought to start a magazine of his own, and it
     was probably with a view to such an eventuality that one of his
     conditions for accepting the editorship of the 'Gentleman's Magazine'
     was that his name should appear upon the title-page.

     Poe worked hard at the 'Gentleman's' for some time, contributing to its
     columns much of his best work; ultimately, however, he came to
     loggerheads with its proprietor, Burton, who disposed of the magazine to
     a Mr. Graham, a rival publisher. At this period Poe collected into two
     volumes, and got them published as 'Tales of the Grotesque and
     Arabesques', twenty-five of his stories, but he never received any
     remuneration, save a few copies of the volumes, for the work. For some
     time the poet strove most earnestly to start a magazine of his own, but
     all his efforts failed owing to his want of capital.

     The purchaser of Burton's magazine, having amalgamated it with another,
     issued the two under the title of 'Graham's Magazine'. Poe became a
     contributor to the new venture, and in November of the year 1840
     consented to assume the post of editor.

     Under Poe's management, assisted by the liberality of Mr. Graham,
     'Graham's Magazine' became a grand success. To its pages Poe contributed
     some of his finest and most popular tales, and attracted to the
     publication the pens of many of the best contemporary authors. The
     public was not slow in showing its appreciation of 'pabulum' put before
     it, and, so its directors averred, in less than two years the
     circulation rose from five to fifty-two thousand copies.

     A great deal of this success was due to Poe's weird and wonderful
     stories; still more, perhaps, to his trenchant critiques and his
     startling theories anent cryptology. As regards the tales now issued in
     'Graham's', attention may especially be drawn to the world-famed
     "Murders in the Rue Morgue," the first of a series--'"une espèce de
     trilogie,"' as Baudelaire styles them--illustrative of an analytic phase
     of Poe's peculiar mind. This 'trilogie' of tales, of which the later two
     were "The Purloined Letter" and "The Mystery of Marie Roget," was
     avowedly written to prove the capability of solving the puzzling riddles
     of life by identifying another person's mind by our own. By trying to
     follow the processes by which a person would reason out a certain thing,
     Poe propounded the theory that another person might ultimately arrive,
     as it were, at that person's conclusions, indeed, penetrate the
     innermost arcanum of his brain and read his most secret thoughts. Whilst
     the public was still pondering over the startling proposition, and
     enjoying perusal of its apparent proofs, Poe still further increased his
     popularity and drew attention to his works by putting forward the
     attractive but less dangerous theorem that "human ingenuity could not
     construct a cipher which human ingenuity could not solve."

     This cryptographic assertion was made in connection with what the public
     deemed a challenge, and Poe was inundated with ciphers more or less
     abstruse, demanding solution. In the correspondence which ensued in
     'Graham's Magazine' and other publications, Poe was universally
     acknowledged to have proved his case, so far as his own personal ability
     to unriddle such mysteries was concerned. Although he had never offered
     to undertake such a task, he triumphantly solved every cryptogram sent
     to him, with one exception, and that exception he proved conclusively
     was only an imposture, for which no solution was possible.

     The outcome of this exhaustive and unprofitable labor was the
     fascinating story of "The Gold Bug," a story in which the discovery of
     hidden treasure is brought about by the unriddling of an intricate
     cipher.

     The year 1841 may be deemed the brightest of Poe's checkered career. On
     every side acknowledged to be a new and brilliant literary light, chief
     editor of a powerful magazine, admired, feared, and envied, with a
     reputation already spreading rapidly in Europe as well as in his native
     continent, the poet might well have hoped for prosperity and happiness.
     But dark cankers were gnawing his heart. His pecuniary position was
     still embarrassing. His writings, which were the result of slow and
     careful labor, were poorly paid, and his remuneration as joint editor of
     'Graham's' was small. He was not permitted to have undivided control,
     and but a slight share of the profits of the magazine he had rendered
     world-famous, whilst a fearful domestic calamity wrecked all his hopes,
     and caused him to resort to that refuge of the broken-hearted--to that
     drink which finally destroyed his prospects and his life.

     Edgar Poe's own account of this terrible malady and its cause was made
     towards the end of his career. Its truth has never been disproved, and
     in its most important points it has been thoroughly substantiated. To a
     correspondent he writes in January 1848:

       "You say, 'Can you _hint_ to me what was "that terrible evil" which
       caused the "irregularities" so profoundly lamented?' Yes, I can do more
       than hint. This _evil_ was the greatest which can befall a man. Six
       years ago, a wife whom I loved as no man ever loved before, ruptured a
       blood-vessel in singing. Her life was despaired of. I took leave of
       her forever, and underwent all the agonies of her death. She recovered
       partially, and I again hoped. At the end of a year, the vessel broke
       again. I went through precisely the same scene.... Then again--again--
       and even once again at varying intervals. Each time I felt all the
       agonies of her death--and at each accession of the disorder I loved
       her more dearly and clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity.
       But I am constitutionally sensitive--nervous in a very unusual degree.
       I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity. During these
       fits of absolute unconsciousness, I drank--God only knows how often or
       how much. As a matter of course, my enemies referred the insanity to
       the drink rather than the drink to the insanity. I had, indeed, nearly
       abandoned all hope of a permanent cure, when I found one in the
       _death_ of my wife. This I can and do endure as becomes a man. It was
       the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope and despair which I
       could _not_ longer have endured, without total loss of reason."

     The poet at this period was residing in a small but elegant little home,
     superintended by his ever-faithful guardian, his wife's mother--his own
     aunt, Mrs. Clemm, the lady whom he so gratefully addressed in after
     years in the well-known sonnet, as "more than mother unto me." But a
     change came o'er the spirit of his dream! His severance from 'Graham's',
     owing to we know not what causes, took place, and his fragile schemes of
     happiness faded as fast as the sunset. His means melted away, and he
     became unfitted by mental trouble and ill-health to earn more. The
     terrible straits to which he and his unfortunate beloved ones were
     reduced may be comprehended after perusal of these words from Mr. A. B.
     Harris's reminiscences.

     Referring to the poet's residence in Spring Gardens, Philadelphia, this
     writer says:

       "It was during their stay there that Mrs. Poe, while singing one
       evening, ruptured a blood-vessel, and after that she suffered a
       hundred deaths. She could not bear the slightest exposure, and needed
       the utmost care; and all those conveniences as to apartment and
       surroundings which are so important in the case of an invalid were
       almost matters of life and death to her. And yet the room where she
       lay for weeks, hardly able to breathe, except as she was fanned, was a
       little narrow place, with the ceiling so low over the narrow bed that
       her head almost touched it. But no one dared to speak, Mr. Poe was so
       sensitive and irritable; 'quick as steel and flint,' said one who knew
       him in those days. And he would not allow a word about the danger of
       her dying: the mention of it drove him wild."

     Is it to be wondered at, should it not indeed be forgiven him, if,
     impelled by the anxieties and privations at home, the unfortunate poet,
     driven to the brink of madness, plunged still deeper into the Slough of
     Despond? Unable to provide for the pressing necessities of his beloved
     wife, the distracted man

       "would steal out of the house at night, and go off and wander about
       the street for hours, proud, heartsick, despairing, not knowing which
       way to turn, or what to do, while Mrs. Clemm would endure the anxiety
       at home as long as she could, and then start off in search of him."

     During his calmer moments Poe exerted all his efforts to proceed with
     his literary labors. He continued to contribute to 'Graham's Magazine,'
     the proprietor of which periodical remained his friend to the end of his
     life, and also to some other leading publications of Philadelphia and
     New York. A suggestion having been made to him by N. P. Willis, of the
     latter city, he determined to once more wander back to it, as he found
     it impossible to live upon his literary earnings where he was.

     Accordingly, about the middle of 1845, Poe removed to New York, and
     shortly afterwards was engaged by Willis and his partner Morris as
     sub-editor on the 'Evening Mirror'. He was, says Willis,

       "employed by us for several months as critic and subeditor.... He
       resided with his wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles out of town,
       but was at his desk in the office from nine in the morning till the
       evening paper went to press. With the highest admiration for his
       genius, and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary
       irregularity, we were led by common report to expect a very capricious
       attention to his duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and
       difficulty. Time went on, however, and he was invariably punctual and
       industrious. With his pale, beautiful, and intellectual face, as a
       reminder of what genius was in him, it was impossible, of course, not
       to treat him always with deferential courtsey.... With a prospect of
       taking the lead in another periodical, he at last voluntarily gave up
       his employment with us."

     A few weeks before Poe relinquished his laborious and ill-paid work on
     the 'Evening Mirror', his marvellous poem of "The Raven" was published.
     The effect was magical. Never before, nor, indeed, ever since, has a
     single short poem produced such a great and immediate enthusiasm. It did
     more to render its author famous than all his other writings put
     together. It made him the literary lion of the season; called into
     existence innumerable parodies; was translated into various languages,
     and, indeed, created quite a literature of its own. Poe was naturally
     delighted with the success his poem had attained, and from time to time
     read it in his musical manner in public halls or at literary receptions.
     Nevertheless he affected to regard it as a work of art only, and wrote
     his essay entitled the "Philosophy of Composition," to prove that it was
     merely a mechanical production made in accordance with certain set
     rules.

     Although our poet's reputation was now well established, he found it
     still a difficult matter to live by his pen. Even when in good health,
     he wrote slowly and with fastidious care, and when his work was done had
     great difficulty in getting publishers to accept it. Since his death it
     has been proved that many months often elapsed before he could get
     either his most admired poems or tales published.

     Poe left the 'Evening Mirror' in order to take part in the 'Broadway
     Journal', wherein he re-issued from time to time nearly the whole of his
     prose and poetry. Ultimately he acquired possession of this periodical,
     but, having no funds to carry it on, after a few months of heartbreaking
     labor he had to relinquish it. Exhausted in body and mind, the
     unfortunate man now retreated with his dying wife and her mother to a
     quaint little cottage at Fordham, outside New York. Here after a time
     the unfortunate household was reduced to the utmost need, not even
     having wherewith to purchase the necessities of life. At this dire
     moment, some friendly hand, much to the indignation and dismay of Poe
     himself, made an appeal to the public on behalf of the hapless family.

     The appeal had the desired effect. Old friends and new came to the
     rescue, and, thanks to them, and especially to Mrs. Shew, the "Marie
     Louise" of Poe's later poems, his wife's dying moments were soothed, and
     the poet's own immediate wants provided for. In January, 1846, Virginia
     Poe died; and for some time after her death the poet remained in an
     apathetic stupor, and, indeed, it may be truly said that never again did
     his mental faculties appear to regain their former power.

     For another year or so Poe lived quietly at Fordham, guarded by the
     watchful care of Mrs. Clemm,--writing little, but thinking out his
     philosophical prose poem of "Eureka," which he deemed the crowning work
     of his life. His life was as abstemious and regular as his means were
     small. Gradually, however, as intercourse with fellow literati
     re-aroused his dormant energies, he began to meditate a fresh start in
     the world. His old and never thoroughly abandoned project of starting a
     magazine of his own, for the enunciation of his own views on literature,
     now absorbed all his thoughts. In order to get the necessary funds for
     establishing his publication on a solid footing, he determined to give a
     series of lectures in various parts of the States.

     His re-entry into public life only involved him in a series of
     misfortunes. At one time he was engaged to be married to Mrs. Whitman, a
     widow lady of considerable intellectual and literary attainments; but,
     after several incidents of a highly romantic character, the match was
     broken off. In 1849 Poe revisited the South, and, amid the scenes and
     friends of his early life, passed some not altogether unpleasing time.
     At Richmond, Virginia, he again met his first love, Elmira, now a
     wealthy widow, and, after a short renewed acquaintance, was once more
     engaged to marry her. But misfortune continued to dog his steps.

     A publishing affair recalled him to New York. He left Richmond by boat
     for Baltimore, at which city he arrived on the 3d October, and handed
     his trunk to a porter to carry to the train for Philadelphia. What now
     happened has never been clearly explained. Previous to starting on his
     journey, Poe had complained of indisposition,--of chilliness and of
     exhaustion,--and it is not improbable that an increase or continuance of
     these symptoms had tempted him to drink, or to resort to some of those
     narcotics he is known to have indulged in towards the close of his life.
     Whatever the cause of his delay, the consequences were fatal. Whilst in
     a state of temporary mania or insensibility, he fell into the hands of a
     band of ruffians, who were scouring the streets in search of accomplices
     or victims. What followed is given on undoubted authority.

     His captors carried the unfortunate poet into an electioneering den,
     where they drugged him with whisky. It was election day for a member of
     Congress, and Poe with other victims, was dragged from polling station
     to station, and forced to vote the ticket placed in his hand. Incredible
     as it may appear, the superintending officials of those days registered
     the proffered vote, quite regardless of the condition of the person
     personifying a voter. The election over, the dying poet was left in the
     streets to perish, but, being found ere life was extinct, he was carried
     to the Washington University Hospital, where he expired on the 7th of
     October, 1849, in the forty-first year of his age.

     Edgar Poe was buried in the family grave of his grandfather, General
     Poe, in the presence of a few friends and relatives. On the 17th
     November, 1875, his remains were removed from their first resting-place
     and, in the presence of a large number of people, were placed under a
     marble monument subscribed for by some of his many admirers. His wife's
     body has recently been placed by his side.

     The story of that "fitful fever" which constituted the life of Edgar Poe
     leaves upon the reader's mind the conviction that he was, indeed, truly
     typified by that:

       "Unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster
       Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden
       bore--
       Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
       Of 'Never--nevermore.'"

     PREFACE.


     These trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their
     redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected
     while going at random the "rounds of the press." I am naturally anxious
     that what I have written should circulate as I wrote it, if it circulate
     at all. In defence of my own taste, nevertheless, it is incumbent upon
     me to say that I think nothing in this volume of much value to the
     public, or very creditable to myself. Events not to be controlled have
     prevented me from making, at any time, any serious effort in what, under
     happier circumstances, would have been the field of my choice. With me
     poetry has been not a purpose, but a passion; and the passions should be
     held in reverence: they must not--they cannot at will be excited, with
     an eye to the paltry compensations, or the more paltry commendations, of
     mankind.

     THE RAVEN.


       Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
       Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--
       While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
       As of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door.
       "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door--
               Only this and nothing more."

       Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
       And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
       Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow
       From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--
       For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
               Nameless here for evermore.

       And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
       Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
       So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
       "'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--
       Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--
           This it is and nothing more."

       Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
       "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
       But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
       And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,
       That I scarce was sure I heard you"--here I opened wide the door:--
             Darkness there and nothing more.

       Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,
         fearing,
       Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
       But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
       And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
       This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"
             Merely this and nothing more.

       Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
       Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.
       "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
       Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--
       Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;--
           'Tis the wind and nothing more."

       Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
       In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
       Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;
       But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--
       Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--
           Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

       Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
       By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
       "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no
         craven,
       Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--
       Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
             Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

       Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
       Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
       For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
       Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--
       Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
             With such name as "Nevermore."

       But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
       That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
       Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
       Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before--
       On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."
             Then the bird said, "Nevermore."

       Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
       "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
       Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
       Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--
       Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore
           Of 'Never--nevermore.'"

       But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
       Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and
         door;
       Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
       Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
       What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
           Meant in croaking "Nevermore."

       This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
       To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
       This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
       On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
       But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
             _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!

       Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
       Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
       "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath
         sent thee
       Respite--respite aad nepenthé from thy memories of Lenore!
       Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthé, and forget this lost Lenore!"
             Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

       "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--
       Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
       Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--
       On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--
       Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!"
           Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

       "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!
       By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--
       Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
       It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
       Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."
             Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

       "Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked,
         upstarting--
       "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
       Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
       Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!
       Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
           Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

       And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
       On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
       And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
       And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
       And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
           Shall be lifted--nevermore!

     THE BELLS,


     I.

       Hear the sledges with the bells--
       Silver bells!
       What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
       How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
       In their icy air of night!
       While the stars, that oversprinkle
       All the heavens, seem to twinkle
       With a crystalline delight;
       Keeping time, time, time,
       In a sort of Runic rhyme,
       To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
       From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
       Bells, bells, bells--
       From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.


     II.

       Hear the mellow wedding bells,
       Golden bells!
       What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
       Through the balmy air of night
       How they ring out their delight!
       From the molten golden-notes,
       And all in tune,
       What a liquid ditty floats
       To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
       On the moon!
       Oh, from out the sounding cells,
       What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
       How it swells!
       How it dwells
       On the future! how it tells
       Of the rapture that impels
       To the swinging and the ringing
       Of the bells, bells, bells,
       Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
       Bells, bells, bells--
       To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!


     III.

       Hear the loud alarum bells--
       Brazen bells!
       What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!
       In the startled ear of night
       How they scream out their affright!
       Too much horrified to speak,
       They can only shriek, shriek,
       Out of tune,
       In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
       In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
       Leaping higher, higher, higher,
       With a desperate desire,
       And a resolute endeavor
       Now--now to sit or never,
       By the side of the pale-faced moon.
       Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
       What a tale their terror tells
       Of Despair!
       How they clang, and clash, and roar!
       What a horror they outpour
       On the bosom of the palpitating air!
       Yet the ear it fully knows,
       By the twanging,
       And the clanging,
       How the danger ebbs and flows;
       Yet the ear distinctly tells,
       In the jangling,
       And the wrangling,
       How the danger sinks and swells,
       By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells--
       Of the bells--
       Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
       Bells, bells, bells--
       In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!


     IV.

       Hear the tolling of the bells--
       Iron bells!
       What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
       In the silence of the night,
       How we shiver with affright
       At the melancholy menace of their tone!
       For every sound that floats
       From the rust within their throats
          Is a groan.
       And the people--ah, the people--
       They that dwell up in the steeple.
           All alone,
       And who toiling, toiling, toiling,
         In that muffled monotone,
       Feel a glory in so rolling
         On the human heart a stone--
       They are neither man nor woman--
       They are neither brute nor human--
           They are Ghouls:
       And their king it is who tolls;
       And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
                Rolls
       A pæan from the bells!
       And his merry bosom swells
       With the pæan of the bells!
       And he dances, and he yells;
       Keeping time, time, time,
       In a sort of Runic rhyme,
       To the pæan of the bells--
           Of the bells:
       Keeping time, time, time,
       In a sort of Runic rhyme,
         To the throbbing of the bells--
       Of the bells, bells, bells--
         To the sobbing of the bells;
       Keeping time, time, time,
         As he knells, knells, knells,
       In a happy Runic rhyme,
       To the rolling of the bells--
       Of the bells, bells, bells--
       To the tolling of the bells,
       Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
         Bells, bells, bells--
       To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.

     ULALUME.


       The skies they were ashen and sober;
         The leaves they were crisped and sere--
         The leaves they were withering and sere;
       It was night in the lonesome October
         Of my most immemorial year;
       It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
         In the misty mid region of Weir--
       It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
         In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

       Here once, through an alley Titanic.
         Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--
         Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
       These were days when my heart was volcanic
         As the scoriac rivers that roll--
         As the lavas that restlessly roll
       Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
         In the ultimate climes of the pole--
       That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
         In the realms of the boreal pole.

       Our talk had been serious and sober,
         But our thoughts they were palsied and sere--
         Our memories were treacherous and sere--
       For we knew not the month was October,
       And we marked not the night of the year--
         (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
       We noted not the dim lake of Auber--
         (Though once we had journeyed down here)--
       Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
         Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

       And now as the night was senescent
         And star-dials pointed to morn--
         As the sun-dials hinted of morn--
       At the end of our path a liquescent
         And nebulous lustre was born,
       Out of which a miraculous crescent
         Arose with a duplicate horn--
       Astarte's bediamonded crescent
         Distinct with its duplicate horn.

       And I said--"She is warmer than Dian:
         She rolls through an ether of sighs--
         She revels in a region of sighs:
       She has seen that the tears are not dry on
         These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
       And has come past the stars of the Lion
         To point us the path to the skies--
         To the Lethean peace of the skies--
       Come up, in despite of the Lion,
         To shine on us with her bright eyes--
       Come up through the lair of the Lion,
         With love in her luminous eyes."

       But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
         Said--"Sadly this star I mistrust--
         Her pallor I strangely mistrust:--
       Oh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!
         Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must."
       In terror she spoke, letting sink her
         Wings till they trailed in the dust--
       In agony sobbed, letting sink her
         Plumes till they trailed in the dust--
         Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

       I replied--"This is nothing but dreaming:
         Let us on by this tremulous light!
         Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
       Its Sibyllic splendor is beaming
         With Hope and in Beauty to-night:--
         See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!
       Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
         And be sure it will lead us aright--
       We safely may trust to a gleaming
         That cannot but guide us aright,
         Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night."

       Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
         And tempted her out of her gloom--
         And conquered her scruples and gloom;
       And we passed to the end of a vista,
         But were stopped by the door of a tomb--
         By the door of a legended tomb;
       And I said--"What is written, sweet sister,
         On the door of this legended tomb?"
         She replied--"Ulalume--Ulalume--
         'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!"

       Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
         As the leaves that were crisped and sere--
         As the leaves that were withering and sere;
       And I cried--"It was surely October
         On _this_ very night of last year
         That I journeyed--I journeyed down here--
         That I brought a dread burden down here!
         On this night of all nights in the year,
         Ah, what demon has tempted me here?
       Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--
         This misty mid region of Weir--
       Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,--
         This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir."

     TO HELEN.


       I saw thee once--once only--years ago:
       I must not say _how_ many--but _not_ many.
       It was a July midnight; and from out
       A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
       Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
       There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,
       With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,
       Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand
       Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,
       Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--
       Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
       That gave out, in return for the love-light,
       Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death--
       Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
       That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted
       By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.

       Clad all in white, upon a violet bank
       I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon
       Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,
       And on thine own, upturn'd--alas, in sorrow!

       Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--
       Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow),
       That bade me pause before that garden-gate,
       To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
       No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,
       Save only thee and me--(O Heaven!--O God!
       How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)--
       Save only thee and me. I paused--I looked--
       And in an instant all things disappeared.
       (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)
       The pearly lustre of the moon went out:
       The mossy banks and the meandering paths,
       The happy flowers and the repining trees,
       Were seen no more: the very roses' odors
       Died in the arms of the adoring airs.
       All--all expired save thee--save less than thou:
       Save only the divine light in thine eyes--
       Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.
       I saw but them--they were the world to me.
       I saw but them--saw only them for hours--
       Saw only them until the moon went down.
       What wild heart-histories seemed to lie unwritten
       Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!
       How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!
       How silently serene a sea of pride!
       How daring an ambition! yet how deep--
       How fathomless a capacity for love!

       But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,
       Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;
       And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
       Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained._
       They _would not_ go--they never yet have gone.
       Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,
       _They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since.
       They follow me--they lead me through the years.

       They are my ministers--yet I their slave.
       Their office is to illumine and enkindle--
       My duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,
       And purified in their electric fire,
       And sanctified in their elysian fire.
       They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),
       And are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to
       In the sad, silent watches of my night;
       While even in the meridian glare of day
       I see them still--two sweetly scintillant
       Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!

     ANNABEL LEE.


       It was many and many a year ago,
         In a kingdom by the sea,
       That a maiden there lived whom you may know
         By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
       And this maiden she lived with no other thought
         Than to love and be loved by me.

       _I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,
         In this kingdom by the sea:
       But we loved with a love that was more than love--
         I and my ANNABEL LEE;
       With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
         Coveted her and me.

       And this was the reason that, long ago,
         In this kingdom by the sea,
       A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
         My beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
       So that her highborn kinsmen came
         And bore her away from me,
       To shut her up in a sepulchre
         In this kingdom by the sea.

       The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
         Went envying her and me--
       Yes!--that was the reason (as all men know,
         In this kingdom by the sea)
       That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
         Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE.

       But our love it was stronger by far than the love
         Of those who were older than we--
         Of many far wiser than we--
       And neither the angels in heaven above,
         Nor the demons down under the sea,
       Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
         Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE.

       For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
         Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
       And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
         Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
       And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
       Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
         In her sepulchre there by the sea--
         In her tomb by the side of the sea.

     A VALENTINE.


       For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,
         Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,
       Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies
         Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.
       Search narrowly the lines!--they hold a treasure
         Divine--a talisman--an amulet
       That must be worn _at heart_. Search well the measure--
         The words--the syllables! Do not forget
       The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor!
         And yet there is in this no Gordian knot
       Which one might not undo without a sabre,
         If one could merely comprehend the plot.
       Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
         Eyes scintillating soul, there lie _perdus_
       Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
         Of poets by poets--as the name is a poet's, too.
       Its letters, although naturally lying
         Like the knight Pinto--Mendez Ferdinando--
       Still form a synonym for Truth--Cease trying!
         You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you _can_ do.

     AN ENIGMA.


       "Seldom we find," says Solomon Don Dunce,
           "Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
         Through all the flimsy things we see at once
           As easily as through a Naples bonnet--
           Trash of all trash!--how _can_ a lady don it?
         Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff--
         Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
           Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it."
         And, veritably, Sol is right enough.
         The general tuckermanities are arrant
         Bubbles--ephemeral and _so_ transparent--
           But _this is_, now--you may depend upon it--
         Stable, opaque, immortal--all by dint
         Of the dear names that lie concealed within't.

     TO MY MOTHER.


       Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,
         The angels, whispering to one another,
       Can find, among their burning terms of love,
         None so devotional as that of "Mother,"
       Therefore by that dear name I long have called you--
         You who are more than mother unto me,
       And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you,
         In setting my Virginia's spirit free.
       My mother--my own mother, who died early,
         Was but the mother of myself; but you
       Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,
         And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
       By that infinity with which my wife
         Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.

     FOR ANNIE.


       Thank Heaven! the crisis--
         The danger is past,
       And the lingering illness
         Is over at last--
       And the fever called "Living"
         Is conquered at last.

       Sadly, I know,
         I am shorn of my strength,
       And no muscle I move
         As I lie at full length--
       But no matter!--I feel
         I am better at length.

       And I rest so composedly,
         Now in my bed,
       That any beholder
         Might fancy me dead--
       Might start at beholding me
         Thinking me dead.

       The moaning and groaning,
         The sighing and sobbing,
       Are quieted now,
         With that horrible throbbing
       At heart:--ah, that horrible,
         Horrible throbbing!

       The sickness--the nausea--
         The pitiless pain--
       Have ceased, with the fever
         That maddened my brain--
       With the fever called "Living"
         That burned in my brain.

       And oh! of all tortures
         _That_ torture the worst
       Has abated--the terrible
         Torture of thirst,
       For the naphthaline river
         Of Passion accurst:--
       I have drank of a water
         That quenches all thirst:--

       Of a water that flows,
         With a lullaby sound,
       From a spring but a very few
         Feet under ground--
       From a cavern not very far
         Down under ground.

       And ah! let it never
         Be foolishly said
       That my room it is gloomy
         And narrow my bed--
       For man never slept
         In a different bed;
       And, to _sleep_, you must slumber
         In just such a bed.

       My tantalized spirit
         Here blandly reposes,
       Forgetting, or never
         Regretting its roses--
       Its old agitations
         Of myrtles and roses:

       For now, while so quietly
         Lying, it fancies
       A holier odor
         About it, of pansies--
       A rosemary odor,
         Commingled with pansies--
       With rue and the beautiful
         Puritan pansies.

       And so it lies happily,
         Bathing in many
       A dream of the truth
         And the beauty of Annie--
       Drowned in a bath
         Of the tresses of Annie.

       She tenderly kissed me,
         She fondly caressed,
       And then I fell gently
         To sleep on her breast--
       Deeply to sleep
         From the heaven of her breast.

       When the light was extinguished,
         She covered me warm,
       And she prayed to the angels
         To keep me from harm--
       To the queen of the angels
         To shield me from harm.

       And I lie so composedly,
         Now in my bed
       (Knowing her love)
         That you fancy me dead--
       And I rest so contentedly,
         Now in my bed,
       (With her love at my breast)
         That you fancy me dead--
       That you shudder to look at me.
         Thinking me dead.

       But my heart it is brighter
         Than all of the many
       Stars in the sky,
         For it sparkles with Annie--
       It glows with the light
         Of the love of my Annie--
       With the thought of the light
         Of the eyes of my Annie.

     TO F--


       Beloved! amid the earnest woes
         That crowd around my earthly path--
       (Drear path, alas! where grows
       Not even one lonely rose)--
         My soul at least a solace hath
       In dreams of thee, and therein knows
       An Eden of bland repose.

       And thus thy memory is to me
         Like some enchanted far-off isle
       In some tumultuous sea--
       Some ocean throbbing far and free
         With storm--but where meanwhile
       Serenest skies continually
         Just o'er that one bright inland smile.

         Be nothing which thou art not.
       So with the world thy gentle ways,
         Thy grace, thy more than beauty,
       Shall be an endless theme of praise.
         And love a simple duty.

     ELDORADO.


         Gaily bedight,
         A gallant knight,
       In sunshine and in shadow,
         Had journeyed long,
         Singing a song,
       In search of Eldorado.
         But he grew old--
         This knight so bold--
       And o'er his heart a shadow
         Fell as he found
         No spot of ground
       That looked like Eldorado.

       And, as his strength
         Failed him at length,
       He met a pilgrim shadow--
         "Shadow," said he,
         "Where can it be--
       This land of Eldorado?"

         "Over the Mountains
         Of the Moon,
       Down the Valley of the Shadow,
         Ride, boldly ride,"
         The shade replied,
       "If you seek for Eldorado!"

     EULALIE.


                    I dwelt alone
                    In a world of moan,
                And my soul was a stagnant tide,
       Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride--
       Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.
                    Ah, less--less bright
                    The stars of the night
                Than the eyes of the radiant girl!
                    And never a flake
                    That the vapor can make
                With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,
       Can vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl--
       Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie's most humble and careless
         curl.
                    Now Doubt--now Pain
                    Come never again,
                For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,
                    And all day long
                    Shines, bright and strong,
                Astarté within the sky,
       While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye--
       While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.

     A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM.


       Take this kiss upon the brow!
       And, in parting from you now,
       Thus much let me avow--
       You are not wrong, who deem
       That my days have been a dream:
       Yet if hope has flown away
       In a night, or in a day,
       In a vision or in none,
       Is it therefore the less _gone_?
       _All_ that we see or seem
       Is but a dream within a dream.

       I stand amid the roar
       Of a surf-tormented shore,
       And I hold within my hand
       Grains of the golden sand--
       How few! yet how they creep
       Through my fingers to the deep
       While I weep--while I weep!
       O God! can I not grasp
       Them with a tighter clasp?
       O God! can I not save
       _One_ from the pitiless wave?
       Is _all_ that we see or seem
       But a dream within a dream?

       Of all who hail thy presence as the morning--

       The blotting utterly from out high heaven
       The sacred sun--of all who, weeping, bless thee

       For the resurrection of deep buried faith
       In truth, in virtue, in humanity--
       Of all who, on despair's unhallowed bed
       Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
       At thy soft-murmured words, "Let there be light!"
       At thy soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
       In thy seraphic glancing of thine eyes--
       Of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude
       Nearest resembles worship,--oh, remember
       The truest, the most fervently devoted,
       And think that these weak lines are written by him--
       By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
       His spirit is communing with an angel's.

     TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW).


       Not long ago, the writer of these lines,
       In the mad pride of intellectuality,
       Maintained "the power of words"--denied that ever
       A thought arose within the human brain
       Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
       And now, as if in mockery of that boast,
       Two words--two foreign soft dissyllables--
       Italian tones, made only to be murmured
       By angels dreaming in the moonlit "dew
       That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,"--
       Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
       Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
       Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
       Than even the seraph harper, Israfel,
       (Who has "the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,")
       Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.
       The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.
       With thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,
       I cannot write--I cannot speak or think--
       Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,
       This standing motionless upon the golden
       Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,
       Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
       And thrilling as I see, upon the right,
       Upon the left, and all the way along,
       Amid empurpled vapors, far away
       To where the prospect terminates--_thee only_!

     THE CITY IN THE SEA.


       Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
       In a strange city lying alone
       Far down within the dim West,
       Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
       Have gone to their eternal rest.
       There shrines and palaces and towers
       (Time-eaten towers and tremble not!)
       Resemble nothing that is ours.
       Around, by lifting winds forgot,
       Resignedly beneath the sky
       The melancholy waters lie.

       No rays from the holy Heaven come down
       On the long night-time of that town;
       But light from out the lurid sea
       Streams up the turrets silently--
       Gleams up the pinnacles far and free--
       Up domes--up spires--up kingly halls--
       Up fanes--up Babylon-like walls--
       Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
       Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers--
       Up many and many a marvellous shrine
       Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
       The viol, the violet, and the vine.

       Resignedly beneath the sky
       The melancholy waters lie.
       So blend the turrets and shadows there
       That all seem pendulous in air,
       While from a proud tower in the town
       Death looks gigantically down.

       There open fanes and gaping graves
       Yawn level with the luminous waves;
       But not the riches there that lie
       In each idol's diamond eye--
       Not the gaily-jewelled dead
       Tempt the waters from their bed;
       For no ripples curl, alas!
       Along that wilderness of glass--
       No swellings tell that winds may be
       Upon some far-off happier sea--
       No heavings hint that winds have been
       On seas less hideously serene.

       But lo, a stir is in the air!
       The wave--there is a movement there!
       As if the towers had thrust aside,
       In slightly sinking, the dull tide--
       As if their tops had feebly given
       A void within the filmy Heaven.
       The waves have now a redder glow--
       The hours are breathing faint and low--
       And when, amid no earthly moans,
       Down, down that town shall settle hence,
       Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
       Shall do it reverence.

     THE SLEEPER


       At midnight, in the month of June,
       I stand beneath the mystic moon.
       An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,
       Exhales from out her golden rim,
       And, softly dripping, drop by drop,
       Upon the quiet mountain top,
       Steals drowsily and musically
       Into the universal valley.
       The rosemary nods upon the grave;
       The lily lolls upon the wave;
       Wrapping the fog about its breast,
       The ruin moulders into rest;
       Looking like Lethe, see! the lake
       A conscious slumber seems to take,
       And would not, for the world, awake.
       All Beauty sleeps!--and lo! where lies
       (Her casement open to the skies)
       Irene, with her Destinies!

       Oh, lady bright! can it be right--
       This window open to the night!
       The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
       Laughingly through the lattice-drop--
       The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
       Flit through thy chamber in and out,
       And wave the curtain canopy
       So fitfully--so fearfully--
       Above the closed and fringed lid
       'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,
       That, o'er the floor and down the wall,
       Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
       Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
       Why and what art thou dreaming here?
       Sure thou art come o'er far-off seas,
       A wonder to these garden trees!
       Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!
       Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
       And this all-solemn silentness!

       The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep
       Which is enduring, so be deep!
       Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
       This chamber changed for one more holy,
       This bed for one more melancholy,
       I pray to God that she may lie
       For ever with unopened eye,
       While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!

       My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
       As it is lasting, so be deep;
       Soft may the worms about her creep!
       Far in the forest, dim and old,
       For her may some tall vault unfold--
       Some vault that oft hath flung its black
       And winged panels fluttering back,
       Triumphant, o'er the crested palls,
       Of her grand family funerals--
       Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
       Against whose portal she hath thrown,
       In childhood many an idle stone--
       Some tomb from out whose sounding door
       She ne'er shall force an echo more,
       Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!
       It was the dead who groaned within.

     BRIDAL BALLAD.


       The ring is on my hand,
         And the wreath is on my brow;
       Satins and jewels grand
       Are all at my command.
         And I am happy now.

       And my lord he loves me well;
         But, when first he breathed his vow,
       I felt my bosom swell--
       For the words rang as a knell,
       And the voice seemed _his_ who fell
       In the battle down the dell,
         And who is happy now.

       But he spoke to reassure me,
         And he kissed my pallid brow,
       While a reverie came o'er me,
       And to the churchyard bore me,
       And I sighed to him before me,
       Thinking him dead D'Elormie,
         "Oh, I am happy now!"

       And thus the words were spoken,
         And thus the plighted vow,
       And, though my faith be broken,
       And, though my heart be broken,
       Behold the golden keys
         That _proves_ me happy now!

       Would to God I could awaken
         For I dream I know not how,
       And my soul is sorely shaken
       Lest an evil step be taken,--
       Lest the dead who is forsaken
         May not be happy now.

     NOTES.


     1.   THE RAVEN


     "The Raven" was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the New
     York 'Evening Mirror'--a paper its author was then assistant editor of.
     It was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written
     by N. P. Willis:

       "We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the second
       number of the 'American Review', the following remarkable poem by
       Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of
       'fugitive poetry' ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in
       English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of
       versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and
       'pokerishness.' It is one of those 'dainties bred in a book' which we
       feed on. It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it."

     In the February number of the 'American Review' the poem was published
     as by "Quarles," and it was introduced by the following note, evidently
     suggested if not written by Poe himself.

       ["The following lines from a correspondent--besides the deep, quaint
       strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some
       ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless
       intended by the author--appears to us one of the most felicitous
       specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The
       resources of English rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and
       sound, producing corresponding diversities of effect, have been
       thoroughly studied, much more perceived, by very few poets in the
       language. While the classic tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by
       power of accent, several advantages for versification over our own,
       chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and
       very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme.
       Alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients
       had in common with us. It will be seen that much of the melody of 'The
       Raven' arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds
       in unusual places. In regard to its measure, it may be noted that if
       all the verses were like the second, they might properly be placed
       merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon form: but the presence
       in all the others of one line--mostly the second in the verse"
       (stanza?)--"which flows continuously, with only an aspirate pause in
       the middle, like that before the short line in the Sapphio Adonic,
       while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with
       any part beside, gives the versification an entirely different effect.
       We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were
       better understood."

     2.   THE BELLS


     The bibliographical history of "The Bells" is curious. The subject, and
     some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet's
     friend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem,
     headed it, "The Bells. By Mrs. M. A. Shew." This draft, now the editor's
     property, consists of only seventeen lines, and reads thus:



     I.

           The bells!--ah the bells!
           The little silver bells!
       How fairy-like a melody there floats
               From their throats--
               From their merry little throats--
               From the silver, tinkling throats
         Of the bells, bells, bells--
                 Of the bells!

     II.

           The bells!--ah, the bells!
           The heavy iron bells!
       How horrible a monody there floats
               From their throats--
               From their deep-toned throats--
               From their melancholy throats
               How I shudder at the notes
         Of the bells, bells, bells--
                 Of the bells!



     In the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it
     to the editor of the 'Union Magazine'. It was not published. So, in the
     following February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much
     enlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without
     publication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current
     version, was sent, and in the following October was published in the
     'Union Magazine'.



            *       *       *       *       *



     3.   ULALUME


     This poem was first published in Colton's 'American Review' for December
     1847, as "To----Ulalume: a Ballad." Being reprinted immediately in
     the 'Home Journal', it was copied into various publications with the
     name of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to him.
     When first published, it contained the following additional stanza which
     Poe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman wisely suppressed:


       Said we then--the two, then--"Ah, can it
           Have been that the woodlandish ghouls--
           The pitiful, the merciful ghouls--
       To bar up our path and to ban it
           From the secret that lies in these wolds--
       Had drawn up the spectre of a planet
           From the limbo of lunary souls--
       This sinfully scintillant planet
           From the Hell of the planetary souls?"



            *       *       *       *       *



     4.   TO HELEN


     "To Helen" (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published Until November
     1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the
     'Union Magazine' and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or
     desire of Poe, of the line, "Oh, God! oh, Heaven--how my heart beats in
     coupling those two words".



            *       *       *       *       *



     5.   ANNABEL LEE


     "Annabel Lee" was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression
     of the poet's undying love for his deceased bride although at least one
     of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a
     copy of the ballad to the 'Union Magazine', in which publication it
     appeared in January 1850, three months after the author's death. Whilst
     suffering from "hope deferred" as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of
     "Annabel Lee" to the editor of the 'Southern Literary Messenger', who
     published it in the November number of his periodical, a month after
     Poe's death. In the meantime the poet's own copy, left among his papers,
     passed into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he
     quoted the poem in an obituary of Poe in the New York 'Tribune', before
     any one else had an opportunity of publishing it.

     6.   A VALENTINE


     "A Valentine," one of three poems addressed to Mrs. Osgood, appears to
     have been written early in 1846.

     7.   AN ENIGMA


     "An Enigma," addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewig ("Stella"), was sent to
     that lady in a letter, in November 1847, and the following March
     appeared in Sartain's 'Union Magazine'.



     *       *       *       *       *



     8.   TO MY MOTHER


     The sonnet, "To My Mother" (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication to
     the short-lived 'Flag of our Union', early in 1849, but does not appear
     to have been issued until after its author's death, when it appeared in
     the 'Leaflets of Memory' for 1850.



     *       *       *       *       *



     9.   FOR ANNIE


     "For Annie" was first published in the 'Flag of our Union', in the
     spring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly
     afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the 'Home Journal'.



     *       *       *       *       *



     10.   TO F----


     "To F----" (Frances Sargeant Osgood) appeared in the 'Broadway Journal'
     for April 1845. These lines are but slightly varied from those inscribed
     "To Mary," in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for July 1835, and
     subsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed, in 'Graham's
     Magazine' for March 1842, as "To One Departed."

     11.   TO FRANCES S. OSGOOD


     "To F--s S. O--d," a portion of the poet's triune tribute to Mrs.
     Osgood, was published in the 'Broadway Journal' for September 1845. The
     earliest version of these lines appeared in the 'Southern Literary
     Messenger' for September 1835, as "Lines written in an Album," and was
     addressed to Eliza White, the proprietor's daughter. Slightly revised,
     the poem reappeared in Burton's 'Gentleman's Magazine' for August, 1839,
     as "To----."



     *       *       *       *       *



     12.   ELDORADO


     Although "Eldorado" was published during Poe's lifetime, in 1849, in the
     'Flag of our Union', it does not appear to have ever received the
     author's finishing touches.



     *       *       *       *       *



     13.   EULALIE


     "Eulalie--a Song" first appears in Colton's 'American Review' for July,
     1845.



     *       *       *       *       *



     14.   A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM


     "A Dream within a Dream" does not appear to have been published as a
     separate poem during its author's lifetime. A portion of it was
     contained, in 1829, in the piece beginning, "Should my early life seem,"
     and in 1831 some few lines of it were used as a conclusion to
     "Tamerlane." In 1849 the poet sent a friend all but the first nine lines
     of the piece as a separate poem, headed "For Annie."



     *       *       *       *       *



     15   TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)


     "To M----L----S----," addressed to Mrs. Marie Louise Shew, was written
     in February 1847, and published shortly afterwards. In the first
     posthumous collection of Poe's poems these lines were, for some reason,
     included in the "Poems written in Youth," and amongst those poems they
     have hitherto been included.



     *       *       *       *       *



     16.  (2)  TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)


     "To----," a second piece addressed to Mrs. Shew, and written in 1848,
     was also first published, but in a somewhat faulty form, in the above
     named posthumous collection.



     *       *       *       *       *



     17.   THE CITY IN THE SEA


     Under the title of "The Doomed City" the initial version of "The City in
     the Sea" appeared in the 1831 volume of Poems by Poe: it reappeared as
     "The City of Sin," in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for August 1835,
     whilst the present draft of it first appeared in Colton's 'American
     Review' for April, 1845.



     *       *       *       *       *



     18.   THE SLEEPER


     As "Irene," the earliest known version of "The Sleeper," appeared in the
     1831 volume. It reappeared in the 'Literary Messenger' for May 1836,
     and, in its present form, in the 'Broadway Journal' for May 1845.



     *       *       *       *       *



     19.   THE BRIDAL BALLAD


     "The Bridal Ballad" is first discoverable in the 'Southern Literary
     Messenger' for January 1837, and, in its present compressed and revised
     form, was reprinted in the 'Broadway Journal' for August, 1845.

     LENORE.


       Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!
       Let the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river.
       And, Guy de Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?--weep now or never more!
       See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
       Come! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!--
       An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young--
       A dirge for her, the doubly dead in that she died so young.

       "Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
       And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died!
       How _shall_ the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung
       By you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue
       That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?"

       _Peccavimus;_ but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song
       Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!
       The sweet Lenore hath "gone before," with Hope, that flew beside,
       Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride--
       For her, the fair and _débonnaire_, that now so lowly lies,
       The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes--
       The life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes.

       "Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,
       But waft the angel on her flight with a pæan of old days!
       Let _no_ bell toll!--lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
       Should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damned Earth.
       To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven--
       From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven--
       From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of Heaven."

     TO ONE IN PARADISE,


       Thou wast that all to me, love,
         For which my soul did pine--
       A green isle in the sea, love,
         A fountain and a shrine,
       All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
       And all the flowers were mine.

       Ah, dream too bright to last!
         Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise
       But to be overcast!
         A voice from out the Future cries,
       "On! on!"--but o'er the Past
         (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
       Mute, motionless, aghast!

       For, alas! alas! with me
         The light of Life is o'er!
       "No more--no more--no more"--
       (Such language holds the solemn sea
         To the sands upon the shore)
       Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
         Or the stricken eagle soar!

       And all my days are trances,
         And all my nightly dreams
       Are where thy dark eye glances,
         And where thy footstep gleams--
       In what ethereal dances,
         By what eternal streams!

       Alas! for that accursed time
         They bore thee o'er the billow,
       From love to titled age and crime,
         And an unholy pillow!
       From me, and from our misty clime,
         Where weeps the silver willow!

     THE COLISEUM.


       Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary
       Of lofty contemplation left to Time
       By buried centuries of pomp and power!
       At length--at length--after so many days
       Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
       (Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,)
       I kneel, an altered and an humble man,
       Amid thy shadows, and so drink within
       My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!

       Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld!
       Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!
       I feel ye now--I feel ye in your strength--
       O spells more sure than e'er Judæan king
       Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!
       O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee
       Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!

       Here, where a hero fell, a column falls!
       Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
       A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!
       Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
       Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!
       Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,
       Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,
       Lit by the wan light of the horned moon,
       The swift and silent lizard of the stones!

       But stay! these walls--these ivy-clad arcades--
       These mouldering plinths--these sad and blackened shafts--
       These vague entablatures--this crumbling frieze--
       These shattered cornices--this wreck--this ruin--
       These stones--alas! these gray stones--are they all--
       All of the famed, and the colossal left
       By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?

       "Not all"--the Echoes answer me--"not all!
       Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever
       From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,
       As melody from Memnon to the Sun.
       We rule the hearts of mightiest men--we rule
       With a despotic sway all giant minds.
       We are not impotent--we pallid stones.
       Not all our power is gone--not all our fame--
       Not all the magic of our high renown--
       Not all the wonder that encircles us--
       Not all the mysteries that in us lie--
       Not all the memories that hang upon
       And cling around about us as a garment,
       Clothing us in a robe of more than glory."

     THE HAUNTED PALACE.


       In the greenest of our valleys
         By good angels tenanted,
       Once a fair and stately palace--
         Radiant palace--reared its head.
       In the monarch Thought's dominion--
         It stood there!
       Never seraph spread a pinion
         Over fabric half so fair!

       Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
         On its roof did float and flow,
       (This--all this--was in the olden
         Time long ago),
       And every gentle air that dallied,
         In that sweet day,
       Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
         A winged odor went away.

       Wanderers in that happy valley,
         Through two luminous windows, saw
       Spirits moving musically,
         To a lute's well-tunëd law,
       Bound about a throne where, sitting
         (Porphyrogene!)
       In state his glory well befitting,
         The ruler of the realm was seen.

       And all with pearl and ruby glowing
         Was the fair palace door,
       Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
         And sparkling evermore,
       A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty
         Was but to sing,
       In voices of surpassing beauty,
         The wit and wisdom of their king.

       But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
         Assailed the monarch's high estate.
       (Ah, let us mourn!--for never morrow
         Shall dawn upon him desolate !)
       And round about his home the glory
         That blushed and bloomed,
       Is but a dim-remembered story
         Of the old time entombed.

       And travellers, now, within that valley,
         Through the red-litten windows see
       Vast forms, that move fantastically
         To a discordant melody,
         While, like a ghastly rapid river,
         Through the pale door
       A hideous throng rush out forever
         And laugh--but smile no more.

     THE CONQUEROR WORM.


       Lo! 'tis a gala night
         Within the lonesome latter years!
       An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
         In veils, and drowned in tears,
       Sit in a theatre, to see
         A play of hopes and fears,
       While the orchestra breathes fitfully
         The music of the spheres.

       Mimes, in the form of God on high,
         Mutter and mumble low,
       And hither and thither fly--
         Mere puppets they, who come and go
       At bidding of vast formless things
         That shift the scenery to and fro,
       Flapping from out their Condor wings
         Invisible Wo!

       That motley drama--oh, be sure
         It shall not be forgot!
       With its Phantom chased for evermore,
         By a crowd that seize it not,
       Through a circle that ever returneth in
         To the self-same spot,
       And much of Madness, and more of Sin,
         And Horror the soul of the plot.

       But see, amid the mimic rout
         A crawling shape intrude!
       A blood-red thing that writhes from out
         The scenic solitude!
       It writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs
         The mimes become its food,
       And the angels sob at vermin fangs
         In human gore imbued.

       Out--out are the lights--out all!
         And, over each quivering form,
       The curtain, a funeral pall,
         Comes down with the rush of a storm,
       And the angels, all pallid and wan,
         Uprising, unveiling, affirm
       That the play is the tragedy, "Man,"
         And its hero the Conqueror Worm.

     SILENCE.


       There are some qualities--some incorporate things,
         That have a double life, which thus is made
       A type of that twin entity which springs
         From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
       There is a twofold _Silence_--sea and shore--
         Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
         Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
       Some human memories and tearful lore,
       Render him terrorless: his name's "No More."
       He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
         No power hath he of evil in himself;
       But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
         Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
       That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
       No foot of man), commend thyself to God!

     DREAMLAND.


       By a route obscure and lonely,
       Haunted by ill angels only,
       Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
       On a black throne reigns upright,
       I have reached these lands but newly
       From an ultimate dim Thule--
       From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
         Out of SPACE--out of TIME.

       Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
       And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
       With forms that no man can discover
       For the dews that drip all over;
       Mountains toppling evermore
       Into seas without a shore;
       Seas that restlessly aspire,
       Surging, unto skies of fire;
       Lakes that endlessly outspread
       Their lone waters--lone and dead,
       Their still waters--still and chilly
       With the snows of the lolling lily.

       By the lakes that thus outspread
       Their lone waters, lone and dead,--
       Their sad waters, sad and chilly
       With the snows of the lolling lily,--

       By the mountains--near the river
       Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,--
       By the gray woods,--by the swamp
       Where the toad and the newt encamp,--
       By the dismal tarns and pools
         Where dwell the Ghouls,--
       By each spot the most unholy--
       In each nook most melancholy,--

       There the traveller meets aghast
       Sheeted Memories of the past--
       Shrouded forms that start and sigh
       As they pass the wanderer by--
       White-robed forms of friends long given,
       In agony, to the Earth--and Heaven.

       For the heart whose woes are legion
       'Tis a peaceful, soothing region--
       For the spirit that walks in shadow
       'Tis--oh, 'tis an Eldorado!
       But the traveller, travelling through it,
       May not--dare not openly view it;
       Never its mysteries are exposed
       To the weak human eye unclosed;
       So wills its King, who hath forbid
       The uplifting of the fringed lid;
       And thus the sad Soul that here passes
       Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

       By a route obscure and lonely,
       Haunted by ill angels only.

       Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
       On a black throne reigns upright,
       I have wandered home but newly
       From this ultimate dim Thule.

       Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
         Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!
       How many memories of what radiant hours
         At sight of thee and thine at once awake!
       How many scenes of what departed bliss!
         How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!
       How many visions of a maiden that is
         No more--no more upon thy verdant slopes!

       _No more!_ alas, that magical sad sound
         Transforming all! Thy charms shall please _no more_--
       Thy memory _no more!_ Accursed ground
         Henceforward I hold thy flower-enamelled shore,

       When the Hours flew brightly by,
       And not a cloud obscured the sky,
       My soul, lest it should truant be,
       Thy grace did guide to thine and thee
       Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast
       Darkly my Present and my Past,
       Let my future radiant shine
       With sweet hopes of thee and thine!

     20.   LENORE


     "Lenore" was published, very nearly in its existing shape, in 'The
     Pioneer' for 1843, but under the title of "The Pæan"--now first
     published in the POEMS OF YOUTH--the germ of it appeared in 1831.

     separate poem entitled "To Ianthe in Heaven," in Burton's 'Gentleman's
     Magazine' for July, 1839. The fifth stanza is now added, for the first

                              AN UNPUBLISHED DRAMA.


     I.

     ROME.--A Hall in a Palace. ALESSANDRA and CASTIGLIONE

     _Alessandra_.     Thou art sad, Castiglione.

     _Castiglione_.    Sad!--not I.
                       Oh, I'm the happiest, happiest man in Rome!
                       A few days more, thou knowest, my Alessandra,
                       Will make thee mine. Oh, I am very happy!

     _Aless_.          Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing
                       Thy happiness--what ails thee, cousin of mine?
                       Why didst thou sigh so deeply?

     _Cas_.            Did I sigh?
                       I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,
                       A silly--a most silly fashion I have
                       When I am _very_ happy. Did I sigh? (_sighing._)

     _Aless_.          Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged
                       Too much of late, and I am vexed to see it.
                       Late hours and wine, Castiglione,--these
                       Will ruin thee! thou art already altered--
                       Thy looks are haggard--nothing so wears away
                       The constitution as late hours and wine.

     _Cas. (musing_ ). Nothing, fair cousin, nothing--
                       Not even deep sorrow--
                       Wears it away like evil hours and wine.
                       I will amend.

     _Aless_.          Do it! I would have thee drop
                       Thy riotous company, too--fellows low born
                       Ill suit the like of old Di Broglio's heir
                       And Alessandra's husband.

     _Cas_.            I will drop them.

     _Aless_.          Thou wilt--thou must. Attend thou also more
                       To thy dress and equipage--they are over plain
                       For thy lofty rank and fashion--much depends
                       Upon appearances.

     _Cas_.            I'll see to it.

     _Aless_.          Then see to it!--pay more attention, sir,
                       To a becoming carriage--much thou wantest
                       In dignity.

     _Cas_.            Much, much, oh, much I want
                       In proper dignity.

     _Aless.
     (haughtily_).     Thou mockest me, sir!

     _Cos.
     (abstractedly_).  Sweet, gentle Lalage!

     _Aless_.          Heard I aright?
                       I speak to him--he speaks of Lalage?
                       Sir Count!
              (_places her hand on his shoulder_)
                                  what art thou dreaming?
                       He's not well!
                       What ails thee, sir?

     _Cas.(starting_). Cousin! fair cousin!--madam!
                       I crave thy pardon--indeed I am not well--
                       Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please.
                       This air is most oppressive!--Madam--the Duke!

     _Enter Di Broglio_.

     _Di Broglio_.     My son, I've news for thee!--hey!
                      --what's the matter?
               (_observing Alessandra_).
                       I' the pouts? Kiss her, Castiglione! kiss her,
                       You dog! and make it up, I say, this minute!
                       I've news for you both. Politian is expected
                       Hourly in Rome--Politian, Earl of Leicester!
                       We'll have him at the wedding. 'Tis his first visit
                       To the imperial city.

     _Aless_.          What! Politian
                       Of Britain, Earl of Leicester?

     _Di Brog_.        The same, my love.
                       We'll have him at the wedding. A man quite young
                       In years, but gray in fame. I have not seen him,
                       But Rumor speaks of him as of a prodigy
                       Pre-eminent in arts, and arms, and wealth,
                       And high descent. We'll have him at the wedding.

     _Aless_.          I have heard much of this Politian.
                       Gay, volatile and giddy--is he not,
                       And little given to thinking?

     _Di Brog_.        Far from it, love.
                       No branch, they say, of all philosophy
                       So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.
                       Learned as few are learned.

     _Aless_.          'Tis very strange!
                       I have known men have seen Politian
                       And sought his company. They speak of him
                       As of one who entered madly into life,
                       Drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs.

     _Cas_.            Ridiculous! Now _I_ have seen Politian
                       And know him well--nor learned nor mirthful he.
                       He is a dreamer, and shut out
                       From common passions.

     _Di Brog_.        Children, we disagree.
                       Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air
                       Of the garden. Did I dream, or did I hear
                       Politian was a _melancholy_ man?

                       (_Exeunt._)




     II.

     ROME.--A Lady's Apartment, with a window open and looking into a garden.
     LALAGE, in deep mourning, reading at a table on which lie some books and
     a hand-mirror. In the background JACINTA (a servant maid) leans
     carelessly upon a chair.


     _Lalage_.         Jacinta! is it thou?

     _Jacinta
     (pertly_).        Yes, ma'am, I'm here.

     _Lal_.            I did not know, Jacinta, you were in waiting.
                       Sit down!--let not my presence trouble you--
                       Sit down!--for I am humble, most humble.

     _Jac. (aside_).   'Tis time.

     (_Jacinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the chair, resting
     her elbows upon the back, and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous
     look. Lalage continues to read._)

     _Lal_.            "It in another climate, so he said,
                       Bore a bright golden flower, but not i' this soil!"

                (_pauses--turns over some leaves and resumes_.)

                       "No lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower--
                       But Ocean ever to refresh mankind
                       Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind"
                       Oh, beautiful!--most beautiful!--how like
                       To what my fevered soul doth dream of Heaven!
                       O happy land! (_pauses_) She died!--the maiden died!
                       O still more happy maiden who couldst die!
                       Jacinta!

               (_Jacinta returns no answer, and Lalage presently resumes_.)

                       Again!--a similar tale
                       Told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea!
                       Thus speaketh one Ferdinand in the words of the play--
                       "She died full young"--one Bossola answers him--
                       "I think not so--her infelicity
                       Seemed to have years too many"--Ah, luckless lady!
                       Jacinta! (_still no answer_.)
                       Here's a far sterner story--
                       But like--oh, very like in its despair--
                       Of that Egyptian queen, winning so easily
                       A thousand hearts--losing at length her own.
                       She died. Thus endeth the history--and her maids
                       Lean over her and keep--two gentle maids
                       With gentle names--Eiros and Charmion!
                       Rainbow and Dove!--Jacinta!

     _Jac_.
     (_pettishly_).    Madam, what is it?

     _Lal_.            Wilt thou, my good Jacinta, be so kind
                       As go down in the library and bring me
                       The Holy Evangelists?

     _Jac_.            Pshaw!

                       (_Exit_)

     _Lal_.            If there be balm
                       For the wounded spirit in Gilead, it is there!
                       Dew in the night time of my bitter trouble
                       Will there be found--"dew sweeter far than that
                       Which hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill."

     (_re-enter Jacinta, and throws a volume on the table_.)

                       There, ma'am, 's the book.
        (_aside_.)     Indeed she is very troublesome.

     _Lal_.
     (_astonished_).   What didst thou say, Jacinta?
                       Have I done aught
                       To grieve thee or to vex thee?--I am sorry.
                       For thou hast served me long and ever been
                       Trustworthy and respectful.
                   (_resumes her reading_.)

     _Jac_. (_aside_.) I can't believe
                       She has any more jewels--no--no--she gave me all.

     _Lal_.            What didst thou say, Jacinta? Now I bethink me
                       Thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding.
                       How fares good Ugo?--and when is it to be?
                       Can I do aught?--is there no further aid
                       Thou needest, Jacinta?

     _Jac_. (_aside_.) Is there no _further_ aid!
                       That's meant for me.  I'm sure, madam, you need not
                       Be always throwing those jewels in my teeth.

     _Lal_.            Jewels! Jacinta,--now indeed, Jacinta,
                       I thought not of the jewels.

     _Jac_.            Oh, perhaps not!
                       But then I might have sworn it. After all,
                       There's Ugo says the ring is only paste,
                       For he's sure the Count Castiglione never
                       Would have given a real diamond to such as you;
                       And at the best I'm certain, madam, you cannot
                       Have use for jewels _now_. But I might have sworn it.

                       (_Exit_)

     (_Lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table--after a
     short pause raises it_.)

     _Lal_.            Poor Lalage!--and is it come to this?
                       Thy servant maid!--but courage!--'tis but a viper
                       Whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul!
                       (_taking up the mirror_)
                       Ha! here at least's a friend--too much a friend
                       In earlier days--a friend will not deceive thee.
                       Fair mirror and true! now tell me (for thou canst)
                       A tale--a pretty tale--and heed thou not
                       Though it be rife with woe. It answers me.
                       It speaks of sunken eyes, and wasted cheeks,
                       And beauty long deceased--remembers me,
                       Of Joy departed--Hope, the Seraph Hope,
                       Inurned and entombed!--now, in a tone
                       Low, sad, and solemn, but most audible,
                       Whispers of early grave untimely yawning
                       For ruined maid. Fair mirror and true!--thou liest not!
                       _Thou_ hast no end to gain--no heart to break--
                       Castiglione lied who said he loved----
                       Thou true--he false!--false!--false!

     (_While she speaks, a monk enters her apartment and approaches
     unobserved_)

     _Monk_.           Refuge thou hast,
                       Sweet daughter! in Heaven. Think of eternal things!
                       Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray!

     _Lal.
     (arising hurriedly_). I _cannot_ pray!--My soul is at war with God!
                       The frightful sounds of merriment below;
                       Disturb my senses--go! I cannot pray--
                       The sweet airs from the garden worry me!
                       Thy presence grieves me--go!--thy priestly raiment
                       Fills me with dread--thy ebony crucifix
                       With horror and awe!

     _Monk_.           Think of thy precious soul!

     _Lal_.            Think of my early days!--think of my father
                       And mother in Heaven! think of our quiet home,
                       And the rivulet that ran before the door!
                       Think of my little sisters!--think of them!
                       And think of me!--think of my trusting love
                       And confidence--his vows--my ruin--think--think
                       Of my unspeakable misery!----begone!
                       Yet stay! yet stay!--what was it thou saidst of prayer
                       And penitence? Didst thou not speak of faith
                       And vows before the throne?

     _Monk_.           I did.

     _Lal_.            'Tis well.
                       There _is_ a vow 'twere fitting should be made--
                       A sacred vow, imperative and urgent,
                       A solemn vow!

     _Monk_.           Daughter, this zeal is well!

     _Lal_.            Father, this zeal is anything but well!
                       Hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?
                       A crucifix whereon to register
                       This sacred vow? (_he hands her his own_.)
                       Not that--Oh! no!--no!--no (_shuddering_.)
                       Not that! Not that!--I tell thee, holy man,
                       Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!
                       Stand back! I have a crucifix myself,--
                       _I_ have a crucifix! Methinks 'twere fitting
                       The deed--the vow--the symbol of the deed--
                       And the deed's register should tally, father!
              (_draws a cross-handled dagger and raises it on high_.)
                       Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine
                       Is written in heaven!

     _Monk_.           Thy words are madness, daughter,
                       And speak a purpose unholy--thy lips are livid--
                       Thine eyes are wild--tempt not the wrath divine!
                       Pause ere too late!--oh, be not--be not rash!
                       Swear not the oath--oh, swear it not!

     _Lal_.            'Tis sworn!




     III.

     An Apartment in a Palace. POLITIAN and BALDAZZAR.


     _Baldazzar_.      Arouse thee now, Politian!
                       Thou must not--nay indeed, indeed, thou shalt not
                       Give way unto these humors. Be thyself!
                       Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee
                       And live, for now thou diest!

     _Politian_.       Not so, Baldazzar!
                       _Surely_ I live.

     _Bal_.            Politian, it doth grieve me
                       To see thee thus!

     _Pol_.            Baldazzar, it doth grieve me
                       To give thee cause for grief, my honored friend.
                       Command me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?
                       At thy behest I will shake off that nature
                       Which from my forefathers I did inherit,
                       Which with my mother's milk I did imbibe,
                       And be no more Politian, but some other.
                       Command me, sir!

     _Bal_.            To the field then--to the field--
                       To the senate or the field.

     _Pol_.            Alas! alas!
                       There is an imp would follow me even there!
                       There is an imp _hath_ followed me even there!
                       There is--what voice was that?

     _Bal_.            I heard it not.
                       I heard not any voice except thine own,
                       And the echo of thine own.

     _Pol_.            Then I but dreamed.

     _Bal_.            Give not thy soul to dreams: the camp--the court
                       Befit thee--Fame awaits thee--Glory calls--
                       And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear
                       In hearkening to imaginary sounds
                       And phantom voices.

     _Pol_.            It _is_ a phantom voice!
                       Didst thou not hear it _then_?

     _Bal_             I heard it not.

     _Pol_.            Thou heardst it not!--Baldazzar, speak no more
                       To me, Politian, of thy camps and courts.
                       Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,
                       Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities
                       Of the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile
                       We have been boys together--school-fellows--
                       And now are friends--yet shall not be so long--
                       For in the Eternal City thou shalt do me
                       A kind and gentle office, and a Power--
                       A Power august, benignant, and supreme--
                       Shall then absolve thee of all further duties
                       Unto thy friend.

     _Bal_.            Thou speakest a fearful riddle
                       I _will_ not understand.

     _Pol_.            Yet now as Fate
                       Approaches, and the Hours are breathing low,
                       The sands of Time are changed to golden grains,
                       And dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!
                       I _cannot_ die, having within my heart
                       So keen a relish for the beautiful
                       As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air
                       Is balmier now than it was wont to be--
                       Rich melodies are floating in the winds--
                       A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth--
                       And with a holier lustre the quiet moon
                       Sitteth in Heaven.--Hist! hist! thou canst not say
                       Thou hearest not _now_, Baldazzar?

     _Bal_.            Indeed I hear not.

     _Pol_.            Not hear it!--listen--now--listen!--the faintest sound
                       And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!
                       A lady's voice!--and sorrow in the tone!
                       Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!
                       Again!--again!--how solemnly it falls
                       Into my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice
                       Surely I never heard--yet it were well
                       Had I _but_ heard it with its thrilling tones
                       In earlier days!

     _Bal_.            I myself hear it now.
                       Be still!--the voice, if I mistake not greatly,
                       Proceeds from younder lattice--which you may see
                       Very plainly through the window--it belongs,
                       Does it not? unto this palace of the Duke.
                       The singer is undoubtedly beneath
                       The roof of his Excellency--and perhaps
                       Is even that Alessandra of whom he spoke
                       As the betrothed of Castiglione,
                       His son and heir.

     _Pol_.            Be still!--it comes again!

     _Voice_
     (_very faintly_). "And is thy heart so strong [1]
                       As for to leave me thus,
                       That have loved thee so long,
                       In wealth and woe among?
                       And is thy heart so strong
                       As for to leave me thus?
                       Say nay! say nay!"


     _Bal_.            The song is English, and I oft have heard it
                       In merry England--never so plaintively--
                       Hist! hist! it comes again!

     _Voice
     (more loudly_).   "Is it so strong
                       As for to leave me thus,
                       That have loved thee so long,
                       In wealth and woe among?
                       And is thy heart so strong
                       As for to leave me thus?
                       Say nay! say nay!"

     _Bal_.            'Tis hushed and all is still!

     _Pol_.            All _is not_ still.

     _Bal_.            Let us go down.

     _Pol_.            Go down, Baldazzar, go!

     _Bal_.            The hour is growing late--the Duke awaits us,--
                       Thy presence is expected in the hall
                       Below. What ails thee, Earl Politian?

     _Voice_
     (_distinctly_).   "Who have loved thee so long,
                       In wealth and woe among,
                       And is thy heart so strong?
                       Say nay! say nay!"

     _Bal_.            Let us descend!--'tis time. Politian, give
                       These fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,
                       Your bearing lately savored much of rudeness
                       Unto the Duke. Arouse thee! and remember!

     _Pol_.            Remember? I do. Lead on! I _do_ remember.
                    (_going_).
                       Let us descend. Believe me I would give,
                       Freely would give the broad lands of my earldom
                       To look upon the face hidden by yon lattice--
                       "To gaze upon that veiled face, and hear
                       Once more that silent tongue."

     _Bal_.            Let me beg you, sir,
                       Descend with me--the Duke may be offended.
                       Let us go down, I pray you.

     _Voice (loudly_). _Say nay_!--_say nay_!

     _Pol_. (_aside_). 'Tis strange!--'tis very strange--methought
                          the voice
                       Chimed in with my desires and bade me stay!
                  (_Approaching the window_)
                       Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.
                       Now be this fancy, by heaven, or be it Fate,
                       Still will I not descend. Baldazzar, make
                       Apology unto the Duke for me;
                       I go not down to-night.

     _Bal_.            Your lordship's pleasure
                       Shall be attended to. Good-night, Politian.

     _Pol_.            Good-night, my friend, good-night.




     IV.

     The Gardens of a Palace--Moonlight. LALAGE and POLITIAN.


     _Lalage_.         And dost thou speak of love
                       To _me_, Politian?--dost thou speak of love
                       To Lalage?--ah woe--ah woe is me!
                       This mockery is most cruel--most cruel indeed!

     _Politian_.       Weep not! oh, sob not thus!--thy bitter tears
                       Will madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage--
                       Be comforted! I know--I know it all,
                       And _still_ I speak of love. Look at me, brightest,
                       And beautiful Lalage!--turn here thine eyes!
                       Thou askest me if I could speak of love,
                       Knowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen
                       Thou askest me that--and thus I answer thee--
                       Thus on my bended knee I answer thee. (_kneeling_.)
                       Sweet Lalage, _I love thee_--_love thee_--_love thee_;
                       Thro' good and ill--thro' weal and woe, _I love thee_.
                       Not mother, with her first-born on her knee,
                       Thrills with intenser love than I for thee.
                       Not on God's altar, in any time or clime,
                       Burned there a holier fire than burneth now
                       Within my spirit for _thee_. And do I love?
                    (_arising_.)
                       Even for thy woes I love thee--even for thy woes--
                       Thy beauty and thy woes.

     _Lal_.            Alas, proud Earl,
                       Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!
                       How, in thy father's halls, among the maidens
                       Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,
                       Could the dishonored Lalage abide?
                       Thy wife, and with a tainted memory--
                       My seared and blighted name, how would it tally
                       With the ancestral honors of thy house,
                       And with thy glory?

     _Pol_.            Speak not to me of glory!
                       I hate--I loathe the name; I do abhor
                       The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.
                       Art thou not Lalage, and I Politian?
                       Do I not love--art thou not beautiful--
                       What need we more? Ha! glory! now speak not of it:
                       By all I hold most sacred and most solemn--
                       By all my wishes now--my fears hereafter--
                       By all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven--
                       There is no deed I would more glory in,
                       Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory
                       And trample it under foot. What matters it--
                       What matters it, my fairest, and my best,
                       That we go down unhonored and forgotten
                       Into the dust--so we descend together?
                       Descend together--and then--and then perchance--

     _Lal_.            Why dost thou pause, Politian?

     _Pol_.            And then perchance
                       _Arise_ together, Lalage, and roam
                       The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,
                       And still--

     _Lal_.            Why dost thou pause, Politian?

     _Pol_.            And still _together_--_together_.

     _Lal_.            Now, Earl of Leicester!
                       Thou _lovest_ me, and in my heart of hearts
                       I feel thou lovest me truly.

     _Pol_.            O Lalage!
                    (_throwing himself upon his knee_.)
                       And lovest thou _me_?

     _Lal_.            Hist! hush! within the gloom
                       Of yonder trees methought a figure passed--
                       A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless--
                       Like the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.
                    (_walks across and returns_.)
                       I was mistaken--'twas but a giant bough
                       Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!

     _Pol_.            My Lalage--my love! why art thou moved?
                       Why dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience self,
                       Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,
                       Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind
                       Is chilly--and these melancholy boughs
                       Throw over all things a gloom.

     _Lal_.            Politian!
                       Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land
                       With which all tongues are busy--a land new found--
                       Miraculously found by one of Genoa--
                       A thousand leagues within the golden west?
                       A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,--
                       And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,
                       And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds
                       Of Heaven untrammelled flow--which air to breathe
                       Is Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter
                       In days that are to come?

     _Pol_.            Oh, wilt thou--wilt thou
                       Fly to that Paradise--my Lalage, wilt thou
                       Fly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,
                       And Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.
                       And life shall then be mine, for I will live
                       For thee, and in thine eyes--and thou shalt be
                       No more a mourner--but the radiant Joys
                       Shall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope
                       Attend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee
                       And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,
                       My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,
                       My all;--oh, wilt thou--wilt thou, Lalage,
                       Fly thither with me?

     _Lal_.            A deed is to be done--
                       Castiglione lives!

     _Pol_.            And he shall die!

                       (_Exit_.)

     _Lal_.
     (_after a pause_). And--he--shall--die!--alas!
                       Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?
                       Where am I?--what was it he said?--Politian!
                       Thou _art_ not gone--thou art not _gone_, Politian!
                       I _feel_ thou art not gone--yet dare not look,
                       Lest I behold thee not--thou _couldst_ not go
                       With those words upon thy lips--oh, speak to me!
                       And let me hear thy voice--one word--one word,
                       To say thou art not gone,--one little sentence,
                       To say how thou dost scorn--how thou dost hate
                       My womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou _art_ not gone--
                       Oh, speak to me! I _knew_ thou wouldst not go!
                       I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, _durst_ not go.
                       Villain, thou _art_ not gone--thou mockest me!
                       And thus I clutch thee--thus!--He is gone, he is gone--
                       Gone--gone. Where am I?--'tis well--'tis very well!
                       So that the blade be keen--the blow be sure,
                       'Tis well, 'tis _very_ well--alas! alas!




     V.

     The Suburbs. POLITIAN alone.


     _Politian_.       This weakness grows upon me. I am fain
                       And much I fear me ill--it will not do
                       To die ere I have lived!--Stay--stay thy hand,
                       O Azrael, yet awhile!--Prince of the Powers
                       Of Darkness and the Tomb, oh, pity me!
                       Oh, pity me! let me not perish now,
                       In the budding of my Paradisal Hope!
                       Give me to live yet--yet a little while:
                       'Tis I who pray for life--I who so late
                       Demanded but to die!--What sayeth the Count?

                   _Enter Baldazzar_.

     _Baldazzar_.      That, knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud
                       Between the Earl Politian and himself,
                       He doth decline your cartel.

     _Pol_.            _What_ didst thou say?
                       What answer was it you brought me, good Baldazzar?
                       With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes
                       Laden from yonder bowers!--a fairer day,
                       Or one more worthy Italy, methinks
                       No mortal eyes have seen!--_what_ said the Count?

     _Bal_.            That he, Castiglione, not being aware
                       Of any feud existing, or any cause
                       Of quarrel between your lordship and himself,
                       Cannot accept the challenge.

     _Pol_.            It is most true--
                       All this is very true. When saw you, sir,
                       When saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid
                       Ungenial Britain which we left so lately,
                       A heaven so calm as this--so utterly free
                       From the evil taint of clouds?--and he did _say_?

     _Bal_.            No more, my lord, than I have told you:
                       The Count Castiglione will not fight.
                       Having no cause for quarrel.

     _Pol_.            Now this is true--
                       All very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,
                       And I have not forgotten it--thou'lt do me
                       A piece of service: wilt thou go back and say
                       Unto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,
                       Hold him a villain?--thus much, I pr'ythee, say
                       Unto the Count--it is exceeding just
                       He should have cause for quarrel.

     _Bal_.            My lord!--my friend!--

     _Pol_. (_aside_). 'Tis he--he comes himself!
            (_aloud_.) Thou reasonest well.
                       I know what thou wouldst say--not send the message--
                       Well!--I will think of it--I will not send it.
                       Now pr'ythee, leave me--hither doth come a person
                       With whom affairs of a most private nature
                       I would adjust.

     _Bal_.            I go--to-morrow we meet,
                       Do we not?--at the Vatican.

     _Pol_.            At the Vatican.

                       (_Exit Bal_.)

                       _Enter Castiglione_.

     _Cas_.            The Earl of Leicester here!

     _Pol_.            I _am_ the Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,
                       Dost thou not, that I am here?

     _Cas_.            My lord, some strange,
                       Some singular mistake--misunderstanding--
                       Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged
                       Thereby, in heat of anger, to address
                       Some words most unaccountable, in writing,
                       To me, Castiglione; the bearer being
                       Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware
                       Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,
                       Having given thee no offence. Ha!--am I right?
                       'Twas a mistake?--undoubtedly--we all
                       Do err at times.

     _Pol_.            Draw, villain, and prate no more!

     _Cas_.            Ha!--draw?--and villain? have at thee then at once,
                       Proud Earl!
                    (_Draws._)

     _Pol_.
     (_drawing_.)      Thus to the expiatory tomb,
                       Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee
                       In the name of Lalage!

     _Cas_. (_letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the
              stage_.)
                       Of Lalage!
                       Hold off--thy sacred hand!--avaunt, I say!
                       Avaunt--I will not fight thee--indeed I dare not.

     _Pol_.            Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?
                       Shall I be baffled thus?--now this is well;
                       Didst say thou _darest_ not? Ha!

     _Cas_.            I dare not--dare not--
                       Hold off thy hand--with that beloved name
                       So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee--
                       I cannot--dare not.

     _Pol_.            Now, by my halidom,
                       I do believe thee!--coward, I do believe thee!

     _Cas_.            Ha!--coward!--this may not be!
     (_clutches his sword and staggers towards Politian, but his purpose is
     changed before reaching him, and he falls upon hia knee at the feet of
     the Earl._)
                       Alas! my lord,
                       It is--it is--most true. In such a cause
                       I am the veriest coward. Oh, pity me!

     _Pol.
     (greatly softened_). Alas!--I do--indeed I pity thee.

     _Cas_.            And Lalage--

     _Pol_.            _Scoundrel!--arise and die!_

     _Cas_.            It needeth not be--thus--thus--Oh, let me die
                       Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting
                       That in this deep humiliation I perish.
                       For in the fight I will not raise a hand
                       Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home--
                    (_baring his bosom_.)
                       Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon--
                       Strike home. I _will not_ fight thee.

     _Pol_.            Now's Death and Hell!
                       Am I not--am I not sorely--grievously tempted
                       To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir:
                       Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare
                       For public insult in the streets--before
                       The eyes of the citizens. I'll follow thee--
                       Like an avenging spirit I'll follow thee
                       Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest--
                       Before all Rome I'll taunt thee, villain,--I'll taunt
                         thee,
                       Dost hear? with _cowardice_--thou _wilt not_ fight me?
                       Thou liest! thou _shalt_!

                       (_Exit_.)

     _Cas_.            Now this indeed is just!
                       Most righteous, and most just, avenging Heaven!

     NOTE ON POLITIAN

     20. Such portions of "Politian" as are known to the public first saw the
     light of publicity in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for December
     1835 and January 1836, being styled "Scenes from Politian; an
     unpublished drama." These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845
     collection of Poems by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft
     subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not
     considered just to the poet's memory to publish it. The work is a hasty
     and unrevised production of its author's earlier days of literary labor;
     and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his
     reputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the
     following fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. The
     Duke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of
     Castiglione her betrothed.



     _Duke_.           Why do you laugh?

     _Castiglione_.    Indeed.
                       I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not
                       On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?
                       Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.
                       Alessandra, you and I, you must remember!
                       We were walking in the garden.

     _Duke_.           Perfectly.
                       I do remember it--what of it--what then?

     _Cas_.            O nothing--nothing at all.

     _Duke_.           Nothing at all!
                       It is most singular that you should laugh
                       At nothing at all!

     _Cas_.            Most singular--singular!

     _Duke_.           Look yon, Castiglione, be so kind
                       As tell me, sir, at once what 'tis you mean.
                       What are you talking of?

     _Cas_.            Was it not so?
                       We differed in opinion touching him.

     _Duke_.           Him!--Whom?

     _Cas_.            Why, sir, the Earl Politian.

     _Duke_.           The Earl of Leicester! Yes!--is it he you mean?
                       We differed, indeed. If I now recollect
                       The words you used were that the Earl you knew
                       Was neither learned nor mirthful.

     _Cas_.            Ha! ha!--now did I?

     _Duke_.           That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time
                       You were wrong, it being not the character
                       Of the Earl--whom all the world allows to be
                       A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,
                       Too positive again.

     _Cas_.            'Tis singular!
                       Most singular! I could not think it possible
                       So little time could so much alter one!
                       To say the truth about an hour ago,
                       As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,
                       All arm in arm, we met this very man
                       The Earl--he, with his friend Baldazzar,
                       Having just arrived in Rome. Ha! ha! he _is_ altered!
                       Such an account he gave me of his journey!
                       'Twould have made you die with laughter--such tales he
                         told
                       Of his caprices and his merry freaks
                       Along the road--such oddity--such humor--
                       Such wit--such whim--such flashes of wild merriment
                       Set off too in such full relief by the grave
                       Demeanor of his friend--who, to speak the truth
                       Was gravity itself--

     _Duke_.           Did I not tell you?

     _Cas_.            You did--and yet 'tis strange! but true, as strange,
                       How much I was mistaken! I always thought
                       The Earl a gloomy man.

     _Duke_.           So, so, you see!
                       Be not too positive. Whom have we here?
                       It cannot be the Earl?

     _Cas_.            The Earl! Oh no!
                       Tis not the Earl--but yet it is--and leaning
                       Upon his friend Baldazzar. Ah! welcome, sir!
                       (_Enter Politian and Baldazzar_.)
                       My lord, a second welcome let me give you
                       To Rome--his Grace the Duke of Broglio.
                       Father! this is the Earl Politian, Earl
                       Of Leicester in Great Britain.
                       [_Politian bows haughtily_.]
                       That, his friend
                       Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. The Earl has letters,
                       So please you, for Your Grace.

     _Duke_.           Ha! ha! Most welcome
                       To Rome and to our palace, Earl Politian!
                       And you, most noble Duke! I am glad to see you!
                       I knew your father well, my Lord Politian.
                       Castiglione! call your cousin hither,
                       And let me make the noble Earl acquainted
                       With your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time
                       Most seasonable. The wedding--

     _Politian_.       Touching those letters, sir,
                       Your son made mention of--your son, is he not?--
                       Touching those letters, sir, I wot not of them.
                       If such there be, my friend Baldazzar here--
                       Baldazzar! ah!--my friend Baldazzar here
                       Will hand them to Your Grace. I would retire.

     _Duke_.           Retire!--so soon?

     _Cas_.            What ho! Benito! Rupert!
                       His lordship's chambers--show his lordship to them!
                       His lordship is unwell.

                  (_Enter Benito_.)

     _Ben_.            This way, my lord!

                  (_Exit, followed by Politian_.)

     _Duke_.           Retire! Unwell!

     _Bal_.            So please you, sir. I fear me
                       'Tis as you say--his lordship is unwell.
                       The damp air of the evening--the fatigue
                       Of a long journey--the--indeed I had better
                       Follow his lordship. He must be unwell.
                       I will return anon.

     _Duke_.           Return anon!
                       Now this is very strange! Castiglione!
                       This way, my son, I wish to speak with thee.
                       You surely were mistaken in what you said
                       Of the Earl, mirthful, indeed!--which of us said
                       Politian was a melancholy man?

                      (_Exeunt_.)

     INTRODUCTION TO POEMS.--1831.


     LETTER TO MR. B--.

     "WEST POINT, 1831

     "DEAR B--

     ...

     Believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second
     edition--that small portion I thought it as well to include in the
     present book as to republish by itself. I have therefore herein combined
     'Al Aaraaf' and 'Tamerlane' with other poems hitherto unprinted. Nor
     have I hesitated to insert from the 'Minor Poems,' now omitted, whole
     lines, and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer
     light, and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they
     may have some chance of being seen by posterity.

     "It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one
     who is no poet himself. This, according to _your_ idea and _mine_ of
     poetry, I feel to be false--the less poetical the critic, the less just
     the critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are
     but few B----s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world's
     good opinion as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here
     observe, 'Shakespeare is in possession of the world's good opinion, and
     yet Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world
     judge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?'
     The difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word 'judgment' or
     'opinion.' The opinion is the world's, truly, but it may be called
     theirs as a man would call a book his, having bought it; he did not
     write the book, but it is his; they did not originate the opinion, but
     it is theirs. A fool, for example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet--yet
     the fool has never read Shakespeare. But the fool's neighbor, who is a
     step higher on the Andes of the mind, whose head (that is to say, his
     more exalted thought) is too far above the fool to be seen or
     understood, but whose feet (by which I mean his every-day actions) are
     sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means of which that
     superiority is ascertained, which _but_ for them would never have been
     discovered--this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great poet--the
     fool believes him, and it is henceforward his _opinion_. This neighbor's
     own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one above _him_, and
     so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the
     summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands upon the
     pinnacle.

     "You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer.
     He is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit
     of the world. I say established; for it is with literature as with law
     or empire--an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in
     possession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,
     improve by travel--their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a
     distinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops
     glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the
     mystic characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely so
     many letters of recommendation.

     "I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think the
     notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is
     another. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent
     would be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad poet
     would, I grant, make a false critique, and his self-love would
     infallibly bias his little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is
     indeed a poet, could not, I think, fail of making a just critique;
     whatever should be deducted on the score of self-love might be replaced
     on account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject; in short, we
     have more instances of false criticism than of just where one's own
     writings are the test, simply because we have more bad poets than good.
     There are, of course, many objections to what I say: Milton is a great
     example of the contrary; but his opinion with respect to the 'Paradise
     Regained' is by no means fairly ascertained. By what trivial
     circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really
     believe! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity. But, in
     fact, the 'Paradise Regained' is little, if at all, inferior to the
     'Paradise Lost,' and is only supposed so to be because men do not like
     epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and reading those of
     Milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the first to
     derive any pleasure from the second.

     "I dare say Milton preferred 'Comus' to either--if so--justly.

     "As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon
     the most singular heresy in its modern history--the heresy of what is
     called, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have
     been induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal
     refutation of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of
     supererogation. The wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge
     and Southey, but being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so
     prosaically exemplified.

     "Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most
     philosophical of all writings--but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce
     it the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry is,
     or should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our
     existence is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our
     existence, everything connected with our existence, should be still
     happiness. Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and
     happiness is another name for pleasure;--therefore the end of
     instruction should be pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion
     implies precisely the reverse.

     "To proceed: _ceteris paribus_, he who pleases is of more importance to
     his fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and
     pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the
     means of obtaining.

     "I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume
     themselves so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they
     refer to instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere
     respect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for
     their judgment; contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since
     their writings are professedly to be understood by the few, and it is
     the many who stand in need of salvation. In such case I should no doubt
     be tempted to think of the devil in 'Melmoth,' who labors indefatigably,
     through three octavo volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or
     two souls, while any common devil would have demolished one or two
     thousand.

     "Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study--not a
     passion--it becomes the metaphysician to reason--but the poet to
     protest. Yet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbued
     in contemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and
     learning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute their
     authority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of my
     heart, that learning has little to do with the imagination--intellect
     with the passions--or age with poetry.

       "'Trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;
       He who would search for pearls must dive below,'

     "are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths,
     men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truth
     lies in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought--not in the palpable
     palaces where she is found. The ancients were not always right in hiding
     the goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown upon
     philosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith--that moral
     mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom
     of a man.

     "We see an instance of Coleridge's liability to err, in his 'Biographia
     Literaria'--professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact, a
     treatise 'de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis'. He goes wrong by reason
     of his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in the
     contemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely sees,
     it is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray--while he who
     surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is
     useful to us below--its brilliancy and its beauty.

     "As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth the
     feelings of a poet I believe--for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy
     in his writings--(and delicacy is the poet's own kingdom--his 'El
     Dorado')--but they have the appearance of a better day recollected; and
     glimpses, at best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know
     that a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the
     glacier.

     "He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end
     of poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the light
     which should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequently
     is too correct. This may not be understood,--but the old Goths of
     Germany would have understood it, who used to debate matters of
     importance to their State twice, once when drunk, and once when
     sober--sober that they might not be deficient in formality--drunk lest
     they should be destitute of vigor.

     "The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into
     admiration of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are full
     of such assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes at
     random)--'Of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is
     worthy to be done, and what was never done before;'--indeed? then it
     follows that in doing what is 'un'worthy to be done, or what 'has' been
     done before, no genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an
     unworthy act, pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington,
     the pick-pocket, in point of genius, would have thought hard of a
     comparison with William Wordsworth, the poet.

     "Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be
     Ossian's or Macpherson's can surely be of little consequence, yet, in
     order to prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages in
     the controversy. 'Tantæne animis?' Can great minds descend to such
     absurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument in
     favor of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his
     abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathise. It is the
     beginning of the epic poem 'Temora.' 'The blue waves of Ullin roll in
     light; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty
     heads in the breeze.' And this--this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where
     all is alive and panting with immortality--this, William Wordsworth, the
     author of 'Peter Bell,' has 'selected' for his contempt. We shall see
     what better he, in his own person, has to offer. Imprimis:

       "'And now she's at the pony's tail,
       And now she's at the pony's head,
       On that side now, and now on this;
       And, almost stifled with her bliss,
       A few sad tears does Betty shed....
       She pats the pony, where or when
       She knows not ... happy Betty Foy!
       Oh, Johnny, never mind the doctor!'

     "Secondly:

       "'The dew was falling fast, the--stars began to blink;
       I heard a voice: it said,--"Drink, pretty creature, drink!"
       And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied
       A snow-white mountain lamb, with a maiden at its side.
       No other sheep was near, the lamb was all alone,
       And by a slender cord was tether'd to a stone.'

     "Now, we have no doubt this is all true: we _will_ believe it,
     indeed we will, Mr, W. Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite?
     I love a sheep from the bottom of my heart.

     "But there are occasions, dear B----, there are occasions when even
     Wordsworth is reasonable. Even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end,
     and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. Here is an
     extract from his preface:

       "'Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers,
       if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion (_impossible!_)
       will, no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha!
       ha! ha!) they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will
       be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have
       been permitted to assume that title.' Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!

     "Yet, let not Mr. W. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, and
     the bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified
     a tragedy with a chorus of turkeys.

     "Of Coleridge, I cannot speak but with reverence. His towering
     intellect! his gigantic power! To use an author quoted by himself,

       '_J'ai trouvé souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une
       bonne partie de ce qu'elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu'elles
       nient_;'

     and to employ his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions by
     the barrier he has erected against those of others. It is lamentable to
     think that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like the
     Nyctanthes, waste its perfume upon the night alone. In reading that
     man's poetry, I tremble like one who stands upon a volcano, conscious
     from the very darkness bursting from the crater, of the fire and the
     light that are weltering below.

     "What is Poetry?--Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as many
     appellations as the nine-titled Corcyra! 'Give me,' I demanded of a
     scholar some time ago, 'give me a definition of poetry.'
     '_Tres-volontiers;_' and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr.
     Johnson, and overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortal
     Shakespeare! I imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon
     the profanity of that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dear
     B----, think of poetry, and then think of Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think of
     all that is airy and fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous and
     unwieldy; think of his huge bulk, the Elephant! and then--and then think
     of the 'Tempest'--the 'Midsummer Night's Dream'--Prospero--Oberon--and
     Titania!

     "A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for
     its _immediate_ object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, for
     its object, an _indefinite_ instead of a _definite_ pleasure, being a
     poem only so far as this object is attained; romance presenting
     perceptible images with definite, poetry with _in_definite sensations,
     to which end music is an _essential_, since the comprehension of sweet
     sound is our most indefinite conception. Music, when combined with a
     pleasurable idea, is poetry; music, without the idea, is simply music;
     the idea, without the music, is prose, from its very definitiveness.

     "What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his
     soul?

     "To sum up this long rigmarole, I have, dear B----, what you, no doubt,
     perceive, for the metaphysical poets as poets, the most sovereign
     contempt. That they have followers proves nothing:

       "'No Indian prince has to his palace
       More followers than a thief to the gallows.'"

     SONNET--TO SCIENCE.


       SCIENCE! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
         Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
       Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,
         Vulture, whose wings are dull realities
       How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
         Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
       To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
         Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing!
       Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
         And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
       To seek a shelter in some happier star?
         Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,
       The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
       The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?

     Private reasons--some of which have reference to the sin of plagiarism,

     AL AARAAF. [1]



     PART I.


       O! nothing earthly save the ray
       (Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty's eye,
       As in those gardens where the day
       Springs from the gems of Circassy--
       O! nothing earthly save the thrill
       Of melody in woodland rill--
       Or (music of the passion-hearted)
       Joy's voice so peacefully departed
       That like the murmur in the shell,
       Its echo dwelleth and will dwell--
       O! nothing of the dross of ours--
       Yet all the beauty--all the flowers
       That list our Love, and deck our bowers--
       Adorn yon world afar, afar--
       The wandering star.

       'Twas a sweet time for Nesace--for there
       Her world lay lolling on the golden air,
       Near four bright suns--a temporary rest--
       An oasis in desert of the blest.
       Away away--'mid seas of rays that roll
       Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul--
       The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)
       Can struggle to its destin'd eminence--
       To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,
       And late to ours, the favour'd one of God--
       But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm,
       She throws aside the sceptre--leaves the helm,
       And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,
       Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.

       Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,
       Whence sprang the "Idea of Beauty" into birth,
       (Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,
       Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,
       It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt),
       She look'd into Infinity--and knelt.
       Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled--
       Fit emblems of the model of her world--
       Seen but in beauty--not impeding sight--
       Of other beauty glittering thro' the light--
       A wreath that twined each starry form around,
       And all the opal'd air in color bound.

       All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
       Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head
       On the fair Capo Deucato [2], and sprang
       So eagerly around about to hang
       Upon the flying footsteps of--deep pride--
       Of her who lov'd a mortal--and so died [3].
       The Sephalica, budding with young bees,
       Uprear'd its purple stem around her knees:
       And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'd [4]--
       Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd
       All other loveliness: its honied dew
       (The fabled nectar that the heathen knew)
       Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven,
       And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
       In Trebizond--and on a sunny flower
       So like its own above that, to this hour,
       It still remaineth, torturing the bee
       With madness, and unwonted reverie:
       In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf
       And blossom of the fairy plant, in grief
       Disconsolate linger--grief that hangs her head,
       Repenting follies that full long have fled,
       Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,
       Like guilty beauty, chasten'd, and more fair:
       Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light
       She fears to perfume, perfuming the night:
       And Clytia [5] pondering between many a sun,
       While pettish tears adown her petals run:
       And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth [6]--
       And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,
       Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
       Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king:
       And Valisnerian lotus thither flown [7]
       From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:
       And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante [8]!
       Isola d'oro!--Fior di Levante!
       And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever [9]
       With Indian Cupid down the holy river--
       Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given
       To bear the Goddess' song, in odors, up to Heaven [10]:

         "Spirit! that dwellest where,
           In the deep sky,
         The terrible and fair,
           In beauty vie!
         Beyond the line of blue--
           The boundary of the star
         Which turneth at the view
           Of thy barrier and thy bar--
         Of the barrier overgone
           By the comets who were cast
         From their pride, and from their throne
           To be drudges till the last--
         To be carriers of fire
           (The red fire of their heart)
         With speed that may not tire
           And with pain that shall not part--
         Who livest--_that_ we know--
           In Eternity--we feel--
         But the shadow of whose brow
           What spirit shall reveal?
         Tho' the beings whom thy Nesace,
           Thy messenger hath known
         Have dream'd for thy Infinity
           A model of their own [11]--
         Thy will is done, O God!
           The star hath ridden high
         Thro' many a tempest, but she rode
           Beneath thy burning eye;
         And here, in thought, to thee--
           In thought that can alone
         Ascend thy empire and so be
           A partner of thy throne--
         By winged Fantasy [12],
            My embassy is given,
         Till secrecy shall knowledge be
           In the environs of Heaven."

       She ceas'd--and buried then her burning cheek
       Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek
       A shelter from the fervor of His eye;
       For the stars trembled at the Deity.
       She stirr'd not--breath'd not--for a voice was there
       How solemnly pervading the calm air!
       A sound of silence on the startled ear
       Which dreamy poets name "the music of the sphere."
       Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call
       "Silence"--which is the merest word of all.

       All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things
       Flap shadowy sounds from the visionary wings--
       But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high
       The eternal voice of God is passing by,
       And the red winds are withering in the sky!
       "What tho' in worlds which sightless cycles run [13],
       Link'd to a little system, and one sun--
       Where all my love is folly, and the crowd
       Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,
       The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath
       (Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?)
       What tho' in worlds which own a single sun
       The sands of time grow dimmer as they run,
       Yet thine is my resplendency, so given
       To bear my secrets thro' the upper Heaven.
       Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,
       With all thy train, athwart the moony sky--
       Apart--like fire-flies in Sicilian night [14],
       And wing to other worlds another light!
       Divulge the secrets of thy embassy
       To the proud orbs that twinkle--and so be
       To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban
       Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!"

        Up rose the maiden in the yellow night,
       The single-mooned eve!-on earth we plight
       Our faith to one love--and one moon adore--
       The birth-place of young Beauty had no more.
       As sprang that yellow star from downy hours,
       Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,
       And bent o'er sheeny mountain and dim plain
       Her way--but left not yet her Therasæan reign [15].



     PART II.


       High on a mountain of enamell'd head--
       Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
       Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,
       Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees
       With many a mutter'd "hope to be forgiven"
       What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven--
       Of rosy head, that towering far away
       Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
       Of sunken suns at eve--at noon of night,
       While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light--
       Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile
       Of gorgeous columns on th' uuburthen'd air,
       Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
       Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,
       And nursled the young mountain in its lair.
       Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall [16]
       Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall
       Of their own dissolution, while they die--
       Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.
       A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,
       Sat gently on these columns as a crown--
       A window of one circular diamond, there,
       Look'd out above into the purple air
       And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
       And hallow'd all the beauty twice again,
       Save when, between th' Empyrean and that ring,
       Some eager spirit flapp'd his dusky wing.
       But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
       The dimness of this world: that grayish green
       That Nature loves the best for Beauty's grave
       Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave--
       And every sculptured cherub thereabout
       That from his marble dwelling peered out,
       Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche--
       Achaian statues in a world so rich?
       Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis [17]--
       From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss
       Of beautiful Gomorrah! Oh, the wave [18]
       Is now upon thee--but too late to save!
       Sound loves to revel in a summer night:
       Witness the murmur of the gray twilight
       That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco [19],
       Of many a wild star-gazer long ago--
       That stealeth ever on the ear of him
       Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,
       And sees the darkness coming as a cloud--
       Is not its form--its voice--most palpable and loud?  [20]
        But what is this?--it cometh--and it brings
       A music with it--'tis the rush of wings--
       A pause--and then a sweeping, falling strain,
       And Nesace is in her halls again.
       From the wild energy of wanton haste
       Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;
       The zone that clung around her gentle waist
       Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.
       Within the centre of that hall to breathe
       She paus'd and panted, Zanthe! all beneath,
       The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair
       And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there!

       Young flowers were whispering in melody [21]
       To happy flowers that night--and tree to tree;
       Fountains were gushing music as they fell
       In many a star-lit grove, or moon-light dell;
       Yet silence came upon material things--
       Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings--
       And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
       Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:

         "Neath blue-bell or streamer--
           Or tufted wild spray
         That keeps, from the dreamer,
           The moonbeam away--[22]
         Bright beings! that ponder,
           With half-closing eyes,
         On the stars which your wonder
           Hath drawn from the skies,
         Till they glance thro' the shade, and
           Come down to your brow
         Like--eyes of the maiden
           Who calls on you now--
         Arise! from your dreaming
           In violet bowers,
         To duty beseeming
           These star-litten hours--
         And shake from your tresses
           Encumber'd with dew

         The breath of those kisses
           That cumber them too--
         (O! how, without you, Love!
           Could angels be blest?)
         Those kisses of true love
           That lull'd ye to rest!
         Up! shake from your wing
           Each hindering thing:
         The dew of the night--
           It would weigh down your flight;
         And true love caresses--
           O! leave them apart!
         They are light on the tresses,
           But lead on the heart.

         Ligeia! Ligeia!
           My beautiful one!
         Whose harshest idea
           Will to melody run,
         O! is it thy will
           On the breezes to toss?
         Or, capriciously still,
           Like the lone Albatross, [23]
         Incumbent on night
           (As she on the air)
         To keep watch with delight
           On the harmony there?

         Ligeia! wherever
           Thy image may be,
         No magic shall sever
           Thy music from thee.
         Thou hast bound many eyes
           In a dreamy sleep--
         But the strains still arise
           Which _thy_ vigilance keep--

         The sound of the rain
           Which leaps down to the flower,
         And dances again
           In the rhythm of the shower--
         The murmur that springs [24]
           From the growing of grass
         Are the music of things--
           But are modell'd, alas!
         Away, then, my dearest,
           O! hie thee away
         To springs that lie clearest
           Beneath the moon-ray--
         To lone lake that smiles,
           In its dream of deep rest,
         At the many star-isles
         That enjewel its breast--
         Where wild flowers, creeping,
           Have mingled their shade,
         On its margin is sleeping
           Full many a maid--
         Some have left the cool glade, and
           Have slept with the bee--[25]
         Arouse them, my maiden,
           On moorland and lea--

         Go! breathe on their slumber,
           All softly in ear,
         The musical number
           They slumber'd to hear--
         For what can awaken
           An angel so soon
         Whose sleep hath been taken
           Beneath the cold moon,
         As the spell which no slumber
           Of witchery may test,
         The rhythmical number
           Which lull'd him to rest?"

       Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,
       A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro',
       Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight--
       Seraphs in all but "Knowledge," the keen light
       That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds afar,
       O death! from eye of God upon that star;
       Sweet was that error--sweeter still that death--
       Sweet was that error--ev'n with _us_ the breath
       Of Science dims the mirror of our joy--
       To them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroy--
       For what (to them) availeth it to know
       That Truth is Falsehood--or that Bliss is Woe?
       Sweet was their death--with them to die was rife
       With the last ecstasy of satiate life--
       Beyond that death no immortality--
       But sleep that pondereth and is not "to be"--
       And there--oh! may my weary spirit dwell--
       Apart from Heaven's Eternity--and yet how far from Hell! [26]

       What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim
       Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
       But two: they fell: for heaven no grace imparts
       To those who hear not for their beating hearts.
       A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover--
       O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)
       Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?
       Unguided Love hath fallen--'mid "tears of perfect moan." [27]

       He was a goodly spirit--he who fell:
       A wanderer by mossy-mantled well--
       A gazer on the lights that shine above--
       A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
       What wonder? for each star is eye-like there,
       And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hair--
       And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy
       To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.
       The night had found (to him a night of wo)
       Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo--
       Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
       And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.
       Here sate he with his love--his dark eye bent
       With eagle gaze along the firmament:
       Now turn'd it upon her--but ever then
       It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.

       "Ianthe, dearest, see! how dim that ray!
       How lovely 'tis to look so far away!
       She seemed not thus upon that autumn eve
       I left her gorgeous halls--nor mourned to leave,
       That eve--that eve--I should remember well--
       The sun-ray dropped, in Lemnos with a spell
       On th' Arabesque carving of a gilded hall
       Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall--
       And on my eyelids--O, the heavy light!
       How drowsily it weighed them into night!
       On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran
       With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:
       But O, that light!--I slumbered--Death, the while,
       Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle
       So softly that no single silken hair
       Awoke that slept--or knew that he was there.

       "The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon
       Was a proud temple called the Parthenon; [28]
       More beauty clung around her columned wall
       Then even thy glowing bosom beats withal, [29]
       And when old Time my wing did disenthral
       Thence sprang I--as the eagle from his tower,
       And years I left behind me in an hour.
       What time upon her airy bounds I hung,
       One half the garden of her globe was flung
       Unrolling as a chart unto my view--
       Tenantless cities of the desert too!
       Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,
       And half I wished to be again of men."

       "My Angelo! and why of them to be?
       A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee--
       And greener fields than in yon world above,
       And woman's loveliness--and passionate love."
       "But list, Ianthe! when the air so soft
       Failed, as my pennoned spirit leapt aloft, [30]
       Perhaps my brain grew dizzy--but the world
       I left so late was into chaos hurled,
       Sprang from her station, on the winds apart,
       And rolled a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.
       Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar,
       And fell--not swiftly as I rose before,
       But with a downward, tremulous motion thro'
       Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!
       Nor long the measure of my falling hours,
       For nearest of all stars was thine to ours--
       Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,
       A red Daedalion on the timid Earth."

       "We came--and to thy Earth--but not to us
       Be given our lady's bidding to discuss:
       We came, my love; around, above, below,
       Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,
       Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod
       _She_ grants to us as granted by her God--
       But, Angelo, than thine gray Time unfurled
       Never his fairy wing o'er fairer world!
       Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes
       Alone could see the phantom in the skies,
       When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
       Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea--
       But when its glory swelled upon the sky,
       As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye,
       We paused before the heritage of men,
       And thy star trembled--as doth Beauty then!"

       Thus in discourse, the lovers whiled away
       The night that waned and waned and brought no day.
       They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts
       Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.

     The drift of Milton's argument leads him to employ language which would
     appear, at first sight, to verge upon their doctrine; but it will be
     seen immediately, that he guards himself against the charge of having
     adopted one of the most ignorant errors of the dark ages of the
     Church.--'Dr. Sumner's Notes on Milton's Christian Doctrine'.

     This opinion, in spite of many testimonies to the contrary, could never
     have been very general. Andeus, a Syrian of Mesopotamia, was condemned
     for the opinion, as heretical. He lived in the beginning of the fourth
     century. His disciples were called Anthropomorphites.--'Vide du Pin'.

     Among Milton's minor poems are these lines:


       Dicite sacrorum præesides nemorum Dese, etc.,
       Quis ille primus cujus ex imagine
       Natura solers finxit humanum genus?
       Eternus, incorruptus, æquævus polo,
       Unusque et universus exemplar Dei.

     --And afterwards,

       Non cui profundum Cæcitas lumen dedit
       Dircæus augur vidit hunc alto sinu, etc.]

       "Je connais bien l'admiration qu'inspirent ces ruines--mais un palais

       d'oeuvre des arts!"]


     [Footnote 18: "Oh, the wave"--Ula Deguisi is the Turkish appellation;
     but, on its own shores, it is called Baliar Loth, or Al-motanah. There
     were undoubtedly more than two cities engulphed in the "dead sea." In
     the valley of Siddim were five--Adrah, Zeboin, Zoar, Sodom and Gomorrah.
     Stephen of Byzantium mentions eight, and Strabo thirteen (engulphed)
     --but the last is out of all reason. It is said (Tacitus, Strabo,
     Josephus, Daniel of St. Saba, Nau, Maundrell, Troilo, D'Arvieux), that
     after an excessive drought, the vestiges of columns, walls, etc., are
     seen above the surface. At 'any' season, such remains may be discovered
     by looking down into the transparent lake, and at such distance as would
     argue the existence of many settlements in the space now usurped by the
     "Asphaltites."]

     [Footnote 22: In Scripture is this passage:

       "The sun shall not harm thee by day, nor the moon by night."

     It is, perhaps, not generally known that the moon, in Egypt, has the
     effect of producing blindness to those who sleep with the face exposed
     to its rays, to which circumstances the passage evidently
     alludes.]

     [Footnote 25: The wild bee will not sleep in the shade if there be
     moonlight. The rhyme in the verse, as in one about sixty lines before,
     has an appearance of affectation. It is, however, imitated from Sir W.
     Scott, or rather from Claud Halcro--in whose mouth I admired its effect:

       O! were there an island,
         Tho' ever so wild,
       Where woman might smile, and
         No man be beguil'd, etc. ]


     [Footnote 26: With the Arabians there is a medium between Heaven and
     Hell, where men suffer no punishment, but yet do not attain that
     tranquil and even happiness which they suppose to be characteristic of
     heavenly enjoyment.

     Sorrow is not excluded from "Al Aaraaf," but it is that sorrow which the
     living love to cherish for the dead, and which, in some minds, resembles
     the delirium of opium.

     The passionate excitement of Love and the buoyancy of spirit attendant
     upon intoxication are its less holy pleasures--the price of which, to
     those souls who make choice of "Al Aaraaf" as their residence after
     life, is final death and annihilation.]

     TAMERLANE.


       Kind solace in a dying hour!
       Such, father, is not (now) my theme--
       I will not madly deem that power
       Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
       Unearthly pride hath revelled in--
       I have no time to dote or dream:
       You call it hope--that fire of fire!
       It is but agony of desire:
       If I _can_ hope--O God! I can--
       Its fount is holier--more divine--
       I would not call thee fool, old man,
       But such is not a gift of thine.

       Know thou the secret of a spirit
       Bowed from its wild pride into shame
       O yearning heart! I did inherit
       Thy withering portion with the fame,
       The searing glory which hath shone
       Amid the Jewels of my throne,
       Halo of Hell! and with a pain
       Not Hell shall make me fear again--
       O craving heart, for the lost flowers
       And sunshine of my summer hours!
       The undying voice of that dead time,
       With its interminable chime,
       Rings, in the spirit of a spell,
       Upon thy emptiness--a knell.

       I have not always been as now:
       The fevered diadem on my brow
       I claimed and won usurpingly--
       Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
       Rome to the Cæsar--this to me?
       The heritage of a kingly mind,
       And a proud spirit which hath striven
       Triumphantly with human kind.
       On mountain soil I first drew life:
       The mists of the Taglay have shed
       Nightly their dews upon my head,
       And, I believe, the winged strife
       And tumult of the headlong air
       Have nestled in my very hair.

       So late from Heaven--that dew--it fell
       ('Mid dreams of an unholy night)
       Upon me with the touch of Hell,
       While the red flashing of the light
       From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,
       Appeared to my half-closing eye
       The pageantry of monarchy;
       And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar
       Came hurriedly upon me, telling
       Of human battle, where my voice,
       My own voice, silly child!--was swelling
       (O! how my spirit would rejoice,
       And leap within me at the cry)
       The battle-cry of Victory!

       The rain came down upon my head
       Unsheltered--and the heavy wind
       Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.
       It was but man, I thought, who shed
       Laurels upon me: and the rush--
       The torrent of the chilly air
       Gurgled within my ear the crush
       Of empires--with the captive's prayer--
       The hum of suitors--and the tone
       Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.

       My passions, from that hapless hour,
       Usurped a tyranny which men
       Have deemed since I have reached to power,
       My innate nature--be it so:
       But, father, there lived one who, then,
       Then--in my boyhood--when their fire
       Burned with a still intenser glow
       (For passion must, with youth, expire)
       E'en _then_ who knew this iron heart
       In woman's weakness had a part.

       I have no words--alas!--to tell
       The loveliness of loving well!
       Nor would I now attempt to trace
       The more than beauty of a face
       Whose lineaments, upon my mind,
       Are--shadows on th' unstable wind:
       Thus I remember having dwelt
       Some page of early lore upon,
       With loitering eye, till I have felt
       The letters--with their meaning--melt
       To fantasies--with none.

       O, she was worthy of all love!
       Love as in infancy was mine--
       'Twas such as angel minds above
       Might envy; her young heart the shrine
       On which my every hope and thought
       Were incense--then a goodly gift,
       For they were childish and upright--
       Pure--as her young example taught:
       Why did I leave it, and, adrift,
       Trust to the fire within, for light?

       We grew in age--and love--together--
       Roaming the forest, and the wild;
       My breast her shield in wintry weather--
       And, when the friendly sunshine smiled.
       And she would mark the opening skies,
       _I_ saw no Heaven--but in her eyes.
       Young Love's first lesson is----the heart:
       For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
       When, from our little cares apart,
       And laughing at her girlish wiles,
       I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,
       And pour my spirit out in tears--
       There was no need to speak the rest--
       No need to quiet any fears
       Of her--who asked no reason why,
       But turned on me her quiet eye!

       Yet _more_ than worthy of the love
       My spirit struggled with, and strove
       When, on the mountain peak, alone,
       Ambition lent it a new tone--
       I had no being--but in thee:
       The world, and all it did contain
       In the earth--the air--the sea--
       Its joy--its little lot of pain
       That was new pleasure--the ideal,
       Dim, vanities of dreams by night--
       And dimmer nothings which were real--
       (Shadows--and a more shadowy light!)
       Parted upon their misty wings,
       And, so, confusedly, became
       Thine image and--a name--a name!
       Two separate--yet most intimate things.

       I was ambitious--have you known
       The passion, father? You have not:
       A cottager, I marked a throne
       Of half the world as all my own,
       And murmured at such lowly lot--
       But, just like any other dream,
       Upon the vapor of the dew
       My own had past, did not the beam
       Of beauty which did while it thro'
       The minute--the hour--the day--oppress
       My mind with double loveliness.

       We walked together on the crown
       Of a high mountain which looked down
       Afar from its proud natural towers
       Of rock and forest, on the hills--
       The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers
       And shouting with a thousand rills.

       I spoke to her of power and pride,
       But mystically--in such guise
       That she might deem it nought beside
       The moment's converse; in her eyes
       I read, perhaps too carelessly--
       A mingled feeling with my own--
       The flush on her bright cheek, to me
       Seemed to become a queenly throne
       Too well that I should let it be
       Light in the wilderness alone.

       I wrapped myself in grandeur then,
       And donned a visionary crown--
       Yet it was not that Fantasy
       Had thrown her mantle over me--
       But that, among the rabble--men,
       Lion ambition is chained down--
       And crouches to a keeper's hand--
       Not so in deserts where the grand--
       The wild--the terrible conspire
       With their own breath to fan his fire.

       Look 'round thee now on Samarcand!--
       Is she not queen of Earth? her pride
       Above all cities? in her hand
       Their destinies? in all beside
       Of glory which the world hath known
       Stands she not nobly and alone?
       Falling--her veriest stepping-stone
       Shall form the pedestal of a throne--
       And who her sovereign? Timour--he
       Whom the astonished people saw
       Striding o'er empires haughtily
       A diademed outlaw!

       O, human love! thou spirit given,
       On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!
       Which fall'st into the soul like rain
       Upon the Siroc-withered plain,
       And, failing in thy power to bless,
       But leav'st the heart a wilderness!
       Idea! which bindest life around
       With music of so strange a sound
       And beauty of so wild a birth--
       Farewell! for I have won the Earth.

       When Hope, the eagle that towered, could see
       No cliff beyond him in the sky,
       His pinions were bent droopingly--
       And homeward turned his softened eye.
       'Twas sunset: When the sun will part
       There comes a sullenness of heart
       To him who still would look upon
       The glory of the summer sun.
       That soul will hate the ev'ning mist
       So often lovely, and will list
       To the sound of the coming darkness (known
       To those whose spirits hearken) as one
       Who, in a dream of night, _would_ fly,
       But _cannot_, from a danger nigh.

       What tho' the moon--tho' the white moon
       Shed all the splendor of her noon,
       _Her_ smile is chilly--and _her_ beam,
       In that time of dreariness, will seem
       (So like you gather in your breath)
       A portrait taken after death.
       And boyhood is a summer sun
       Whose waning is the dreariest one--
       For all we live to know is known,
       And all we seek to keep hath flown--
       Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall
       With the noon-day beauty--which is all.
       I reached my home--my home no more--
       For all had flown who made it so.
       I passed from out its mossy door,
       And, tho' my tread was soft and low,
       A voice came from the threshold stone
       Of one whom I had earlier known--
       O, I defy thee, Hell, to show
       On beds of fire that burn below,
       An humbler heart--a deeper woe.

       Father, I firmly do believe--
       I _know_--for Death who comes for me
       From regions of the blest afar,
       Where there is nothing to deceive,
       Hath left his iron gate ajar.
       And rays of truth you cannot see
       Are flashing thro' Eternity----
       I do believe that Eblis hath
       A snare in every human path--
       Else how, when in the holy grove
       I wandered of the idol, Love,--
       Who daily scents his snowy wings
       With incense of burnt-offerings
       From the most unpolluted things,
       Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
       Above with trellised rays from Heaven
       No mote may shun--no tiniest fly--
       The light'ning of his eagle eye--
       How was it that Ambition crept,
       Unseen, amid the revels there,
       Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
       In the tangles of Love's very hair!

     TO HELEN.


       Helen, thy beauty is to me
         Like those Nicean barks of yore,
       That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
         The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
         To his own native shore.

       On desperate seas long wont to roam,
         Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
       Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
         To the glory that was Greece,
       To the grandeur that was Rome.

       Lo! in yon brilliant window niche,
         How statue-like I see thee stand,
         The agate lamp within thy hand!
       Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
         Are Holy Land!

     THE VALLEY OF UNREST.


       _Once_ it smiled a silent dell
       Where the people did not dwell;
       They had gone unto the wars,
       Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
       Nightly, from their azure towers,
       To keep watch above the flowers,
       In the midst of which all day
       The red sun-light lazily lay,
       _Now_ each visitor shall confess
       The sad valley's restlessness.
       Nothing there is motionless--
       Nothing save the airs that brood
       Over the magic solitude.
       Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
       That palpitate like the chill seas
       Around the misty Hebrides!
       Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
       That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
       Unceasingly, from morn till even,
       Over the violets there that lie
       In myriad types of the human eye--
       Over the lilies that wave
       And weep above a nameless grave!
       They wave:--from out their fragrant tops
       Eternal dews come down in drops.
       They weep:--from off their delicate stems
       Perennial tears descend in gems.

     ISRAFEL. [1]


       In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
         "Whose heart-strings are a lute;"
       None sing so wildly well
       As the angel Israfel,
       And the giddy Stars (so legends tell),
       Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
         Of his voice, all mute.

       Tottering above
         In her highest noon,
         The enamoured Moon
       Blushes with love,
         While, to listen, the red levin
         (With the rapid Pleiads, even,
         Which were seven),
         Pauses in Heaven.

       And they say (the starry choir
         And the other listening things)
       That Israfeli's fire
       Is owing to that lyre
         By which he sits and sings--
       The trembling living wire
       Of those unusual strings.

       But the skies that angel trod,
         Where deep thoughts are a duty--
       Where Love's a grow-up God--
         Where the Houri glances are
       Imbued with all the beauty
         Which we worship in a star.

       Therefore, thou art not wrong,
         Israfeli, who despisest
       An unimpassioned song;
       To thee the laurels belong,
         Best bard, because the wisest!
       Merrily live and long!

       The ecstasies above
         With thy burning measures suit--
       Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
         With the fervor of thy lute--
         Well may the stars be mute!

       Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
         Is a world of sweets and sours;
         Our flowers are merely--flowers,
       And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
         Is the sunshine of ours.

       If I could dwell
       Where Israfel
         Hath dwelt, and he where I,
       He might not sing so wildly well
         A mortal melody,
       While a bolder note than this might swell
         From my lyre within the sky.


     1836.



     [Footnote 1:

       And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lute, and who has the
       sweetest voice of all God's creatures.

       I heed not that my earthly lot
         Hath--little of Earth in it--
       That years of love have been forgot
         In the hatred of a minute:--
       I mourn not that the desolate
         Are happier, sweet, than I,
       But that _you_ sorrow for _my_ fate
         Who am a passer-by.

         The wantonest singing birds,

       Are lips--and all thy melody
         Of lip-begotten words--

       Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrined
         Then desolately fall,
       O God! on my funereal mind
         Like starlight on a pall--

       Thy heart--_thy_ heart!--I wake and sigh,
         And sleep to dream till day
       Of the truth that gold can never buy--
         Of the baubles that it may.

     TO THE RIVER


       Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow
         Of crystal, wandering water,
       Thou art an emblem of the glow
             Of beauty--the unhidden heart--
             The playful maziness of art
         In old Alberto's daughter;

       But when within thy wave she looks--
         Which glistens then, and trembles--
       Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
         Her worshipper resembles;
       For in his heart, as in thy stream,
         Her image deeply lies--
       His heart which trembles at the beam
         Of her soul-searching eyes.

     SONG.


       I saw thee on thy bridal day--
         When a burning blush came o'er thee,
       Though happiness around thee lay,
         The world all love before thee:

       And in thine eye a kindling light
         (Whatever it might be)
       Was all on Earth my aching sight
         Of Loveliness could see.

       That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame--
         As such it well may pass--
       Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
         In the breast of him, alas!

       Who saw thee on that bridal day,
         When that deep blush _would_ come o'er thee,
       Though happiness around thee lay,
         The world all love before thee.

     SPIRITS OF THE DEAD.


       Thy soul shall find itself alone
       'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone
       Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
       Into thine hour of secrecy.
       Be silent in that solitude
         Which is not loneliness--for then
       The spirits of the dead who stood
         In life before thee are again
       In death around thee--and their will
       Shall overshadow thee: be still.
       The night--tho' clear--shall frown--
       And the stars shall not look down
       From their high thrones in the Heaven,
       With light like Hope to mortals given--
       But their red orbs, without beam,
       To thy weariness shall seem
       As a burning and a fever
       Which would cling to thee forever.
       Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish--
       Now are visions ne'er to vanish--
       From thy spirit shall they pass
       No more--like dew-drops from the grass.
       The breeze--the breath of God--is still--
       And the mist upon the hill
       Shadowy--shadowy--yet unbroken,
         Is a symbol and a token--
         How it hangs upon the trees,
         A mystery of mysteries!

     A DREAM.


       In visions of the dark night
         I have dreamed of joy departed--
       But a waking dream of life and light
         Hath left me broken-hearted.

       Ah! what is not a dream by day
         To him whose eyes are cast
       On things around him with a ray
         Turned back upon the past?

       That holy dream--that holy dream,
         While all the world were chiding,
       Hath cheered me as a lovely beam,
         A lonely spirit guiding.

       What though that light, thro' storm and night,
         So trembled from afar--
       What could there be more purely bright
         In Truth's day star?

     ROMANCE.


       Romance, who loves to nod and sing,
       With drowsy head and folded wing,
       Among the green leaves as they shake
       Far down within some shadowy lake,
       To me a painted paroquet
       Hath been--a most familiar bird--
       Taught me my alphabet to say--
       To lisp my very earliest word
       While in the wild wood I did lie,
       A child--with a most knowing eye.

       Of late, eternal Condor years
       So shake the very Heaven on high
       With tumult as they thunder by,
       I have no time for idle cares
       Though gazing on the unquiet sky.
       And when an hour with calmer wings
       Its down upon my spirit flings--
       That little time with lyre and rhyme
       To while away--forbidden things!
       My heart would feel to be a crime
       Unless it trembled with the strings.

     FAIRYLAND.


       Dim vales--and shadowy floods--
       And cloudy-looking woods,
       Whose forms we can't discover
       For the tears that drip all over
       Huge moons there wax and wane--
       Again--again--again--
       Every moment of the night--
       Forever changing places--
       And they put out the star-light
       With the breath from their pale faces.
       About twelve by the moon-dial
       One more filmy than the rest
       (A kind which, upon trial,
       They have found to be the best)
       Comes down--still down--and down
       With its centre on the crown
       Of a mountain's eminence,
       While its wide circumference
       In easy drapery falls
       Over hamlets, over halls,
       Wherever they may be--
       O'er the strange woods--o'er the sea--
       Over spirits on the wing--
       Over every drowsy thing--
       And buries them up quite
       In a labyrinth of light--
       And then, how deep!--O, deep!
       Is the passion of their sleep.
       In the morning they arise,
       And their moony covering
       Is soaring in the skies,
       With the tempests as they toss,
       Like--almost any thing--
       Or a yellow Albatross.
       They use that moon no more
       For the same end as before--
       Videlicet a tent--
       Which I think extravagant:
       Its atomies, however,
       Into a shower dissever,
       Of which those butterflies,
       Of Earth, who seek the skies,
       And so come down again
       (Never-contented thing!)
       Have brought a specimen
       Upon their quivering wings.

     THE LAKE.


       In spring of youth it was my lot
       To haunt of the wide world a spot
       The which I could not love the less--
       So lovely was the loneliness
       Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,
       And the tall pines that towered around.

       But when the Night had thrown her pall
       Upon the spot, as upon all,
       And the mystic wind went by
       Murmuring in melody--
       Then--ah, then, I would awake
       To the terror of the lone lake.

       Yet that terror was not fright,
       But a tremulous delight--
       A feeling not the jewelled mine
       Could teach or bribe me to define--
       Nor Love--although the Love were thine.

       Death was in that poisonous wave,
       And in its gulf a fitting grave
       For him who thence could solace bring
       To his lone imagining--
       Whose solitary soul could make
       An Eden of that dim lake.

     EVENING STAR.


       'Twas noontide of summer,
         And midtime of night,
       And stars, in their orbits,
         Shone pale, through the light
       Of the brighter, cold moon.
         'Mid planets her slaves,
       Herself in the Heavens,
         Her beam on the waves.

         I gazed awhile
         On her cold smile;
       Too cold--too cold for me--
         There passed, as a shroud,
         A fleecy cloud,
       And I turned away to thee,
         Proud Evening Star,
         In thy glory afar
       And dearer thy beam shall be;
         For joy to my heart
         Is the proud part
       Thou bearest in Heaven at night,
         And more I admire
         Thy distant fire,
       Than that colder, lowly light.

     IMITATION.


       A dark unfathomed tide
       Of interminable pride--
       A mystery, and a dream,
       Should my early life seem;
       I say that dream was fraught
       With a wild and waking thought
       Of beings that have been,
       Which my spirit hath not seen,
       Had I let them pass me by,
       With a dreaming eye!
       Let none of earth inherit
       That vision on my spirit;
       Those thoughts I would control,
       As a spell upon his soul:
       For that bright hope at last
       And that light time have past,
       And my wordly rest hath gone
       With a sigh as it passed on:
       I care not though it perish
       With a thought I then did cherish.

     "THE HAPPIEST DAY."


          I.       The happiest day--the happiest hour
                     My seared and blighted heart hath known,
                   The highest hope of pride and power,
                     I feel hath flown.


          II.      Of power! said I? Yes! such I ween
                     But they have vanished long, alas!
                   The visions of my youth have been--
                     But let them pass.


          III.     And pride, what have I now with thee?
                     Another brow may ev'n inherit
                   The venom thou hast poured on me--
                     Be still my spirit!


          IV.      The happiest day--the happiest hour
                     Mine eyes shall see--have ever seen
                   The brightest glance of pride and power
                     I feel have been:


          V.       But were that hope of pride and power
                     Now offered with the pain
                   Ev'n _then_ I felt--that brightest hour
                     I would not live again:

          VI.      For on its wing was dark alloy
                     And as it fluttered--fell
                   An essence--powerful to destroy
                     A soul that knew it well.

     HYMN TO ARISTOGEITON AND HARMODIUS.


       I.      Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll conceal,
                 Like those champions devoted and brave,
               When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,
                 And to Athens deliverance gave.

       II.     Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam
                 In the joy breathing isles of the blest;
               Where the mighty of old have their home--
                 Where Achilles and Diomed rest.

       III.    In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine,
                 Like Harmodius, the gallant and good,
               When he made at the tutelar shrine
                 A libation of Tyranny's blood.

       IV.     Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!
                 Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs!
               Endless ages shall cherish your fame,
                 Embalmed in their echoing songs!

     DREAMS.


       Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!
       My spirit not awakening, till the beam
       Of an Eternity should bring the morrow.
       Yes! though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,
       'Twere better than the cold reality
       Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,
       And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,
       A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.
       But should it be--that dream eternally
       Continuing--as dreams have been to me
       In my young boyhood--should it thus be given,
       'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.
       For I have revelled when the sun was bright
       I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light
       And loveliness,--have left my very heart
       Inclines of my imaginary apart [1]
       From mine own home, with beings that have been
       Of mine own thought--what more could I have seen?
       'Twas once--and only once--and the wild hour
       From my remembrance shall not pass--some power
       Or spell had bound me--'twas the chilly wind
       Came o'er me in the night, and left behind
       Its image on my spirit--or the moon
       Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
       Too coldly--or the stars--howe'er it was
       That dream was that that night-wind--let it pass.
       _I have been_ happy, though in a dream.
       I have been happy--and I love the theme:
       Dreams! in their vivid coloring of life
       As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife
       Of semblance with reality which brings
       To the delirious eye, more lovely things
       Of Paradise and Love--and all my own!--
       Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.

     "IN YOUTH I HAVE KNOWN ONE."


               _How often we forget all time, when lone
               Admiring Nature's universal throne;
               Her woods--her wilds--her mountains--the intense
               Reply of Hers to Our intelligence!_


     I.        In youth I have known one with whom the Earth
                 In secret communing held--as he with it,
               In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth:
                 Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit
               From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth
                 A passionate light such for his spirit was fit--
               And yet that spirit knew--not in the hour
                 Of its own fervor--what had o'er it power.


     II.       Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
                 To a ferver [1] by the moonbeam that hangs o'er,
               But I will half believe that wild light fraught
                 With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
               Hath ever told--or is it of a thought
                 The unembodied essence, and no more
               That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass
                 As dew of the night-time, o'er the summer grass?


     III.      Doth o'er us pass, when, as th' expanding eye
                 To the loved object--so the tear to the lid
               Will start, which lately slept in apathy?
                 And yet it need not be--(that object) hid
               From us in life--but common--which doth lie
                 Each hour before us--but then only bid
               With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken
                 T' awake us--'Tis a symbol and a token--


     IV.       Of what in other worlds shall be--and given
                 In beauty by our God, to those alone
               Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven
                 Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,
               That high tone of the spirit which hath striven
                 Though not with Faith--with godliness--whose throne
               With desperate energy 't hath beaten down;
                 Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.

     A PÆAN.



     I.        How shall the burial rite be read?
                 The solemn song be sung?
               The requiem for the loveliest dead,
                 That ever died so young?


     II.       Her friends are gazing on her,
                 And on her gaudy bier,
               And weep!--oh! to dishonor
                 Dead beauty with a tear!


     III.     They loved her for her wealth--
                And they hated her for her pride--
               But she grew in feeble health,
                 And they _love_ her--that she died.


     IV.      They tell me (while they speak
                Of her "costly broider'd pall")
              That my voice is growing weak--
                That I should not sing at all--


     V.       Or that my tone should be
                Tun'd to such solemn song
              So mournfully--so mournfully,
                That the dead may feel no wrong.


     VI.      But she is gone above,
                With young Hope at her side,
              And I am drunk with love
                Of the dead, who is my bride.--

     VII.     Of the dead--dead who lies
                All perfum'd there,
              With the death upon her eyes.
                And the life upon her hair.


     VIII.    Thus on the coffin loud and long
                I strike--the murmur sent
              Through the gray chambers to my song,
                Shall be the accompaniment.


     IX.      Thou diedst in thy life's June--
                But thou didst not die too fair:
              Thou didst not die too soon,
                Nor with too calm an air.


     X.       From more than friends on earth,
                Thy life and love are riven,
              To join the untainted mirth
                Of more than thrones in heaven.--


     XI.      Therefore, to thee this night
                I will no requiem raise,
              But waft thee on thy flight,
                With a Pæan of old days.

     NOTES.

     30. On the "Poems written in Youth" little comment is needed. This
     section includes the pieces printed for the first volume of 1827 (which
     was subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second
     published volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in
     their revised versions, and a few others collected from various sources.

     "Al Aaraaf" first appeared, with the sonnet "To Silence" prefixed to it,
     in 1829, and is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for
     1831, however, this poem, its author's longest, was introduced by the
     following twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in all subsequent
     collections:


     AL AARAAF.


       Mysterious star!
       Thou wert my dream
       All a long summer night--
       Be now my theme!
       By this clear stream,
       Of thee will I write;
       Meantime from afar
       Bathe me in light!

       Thy world has not the dross of ours,
       Yet all the beauty--all the flowers
       That list our love or deck our bowers
       In dreamy gardens, where do lie
       Dreamy maidens all the day;
       While the silver winds of Circassy
       On violet couches faint away.
       Little--oh! little dwells in thee
       Like unto what on earth we see:
       Beauty's eye is here the bluest
       In the falsest and untruest--
       On the sweetest air doth float
       The most sad and solemn note--
       If with thee be broken hearts,
       Joy so peacefully departs,
       That its echo still doth dwell,
       Like the murmur in the shell.
       Thou! thy truest type of grief
       Is the gently falling leaf--
       Thou! thy framing is so holy
       Sorrow is not melancholy.



            *       *       *       *       *



     31. The earliest version of "Tamerlane" was included in the suppressed
     volume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now
     published. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and
     improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the
     lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at
     least.



            *       *       *       *       *



     32. "To Helen" first appeared in the 1831 volume, as did also "The
     Valley of Unrest" (as "The Valley Nis"), "Israfel," and one or two
     others of the youthful pieces.

     The poem styled "Romance" constituted the Preface of the 1829 volume,
     but with the addition of the following lines:


       Succeeding years, too wild for song,
       Then rolled like tropic storms along,
       Where, though the garish lights that fly
       Dying along the troubled sky,
       Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,
       The blackness of the general Heaven,
       That very blackness yet doth fling
       Light on the lightning's silver wing.

       For being an idle boy lang syne,
       Who read Anacreon and drank wine,
       I early found Anacreon rhymes
       Were almost passionate sometimes--
       And by strange alchemy of brain
       His pleasures always turned to pain--
       His naïveté to wild desire--
       His wit to love--his wine to fire--
       And so, being young and dipt in folly,
       I fell in love with melancholy.

       And used to throw my earthly rest
       And quiet all away in jest--
       I could not love except where Death
       Was mingling his with Beauty's breath--
       Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,
       Were stalking between her and me.

            *       *       *       *       *

       But _now_ my soul hath too much room--
       Gone are the glory and the gloom--
       The black hath mellow'd into gray,
       And all the fires are fading away.

       My draught of passion hath been deep--
       I revell'd, and I now would sleep--
       And after drunkenness of soul
       Succeeds the glories of the bowl--
       An idle longing night and day
       To dream my very life away.

       But dreams--of those who dream as I,
       Aspiringly, are damned, and die:
       Yet should I swear I mean alone,
       By notes so very shrilly blown,
       To break upon Time's monotone,
       While yet my vapid joy and grief
       Are tintless of the yellow leaf--
       Why not an imp the greybeard hath,
       Will shake his shadow in my path--
       And e'en the greybeard will o'erlook
       Connivingly my dreaming-book.

     ALONE.


       From childhood's hour I have not been
       As others were--I have not seen
       As others saw--I could not bring
       My passions from a common spring--
       From the same source I have not taken
       My sorrow--I could not awaken
       My heart to joy at the same tone--
       And all I loved--_I_ loved alone--
       _Thou_--in my childhood--in the dawn
       Of a most stormy life--was drawn
       From every depth of good and ill
       The mystery which binds me still--
       From the torrent, or the fountain--
       From the red cliff of the mountain--
       From the sun that round me roll'd
       In its autumn tint of gold--
       From the lightning in the sky
       As it passed me flying by--
       From the thunder and the storm--
       And the cloud that took the form
       (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
       Of a demon in my view.

     TO ISADORE.


     I.       Beneath the vine-clad eaves,
                  Whose shadows fall before
                  Thy lowly cottage door--
              Under the lilac's tremulous leaves--
              Within thy snowy clasped hand
                  The purple flowers it bore.
              Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand,
              Like queenly nymph from Fairy-land--
              Enchantress of the flowery wand,
                  Most beauteous Isadore!


     II.      And when I bade the dream
                  Upon thy spirit flee,
                  Thy violet eyes to me
              Upturned, did overflowing seem
              With the deep, untold delight
                  Of Love's serenity;
              Thy classic brow, like lilies white
              And pale as the Imperial Night
              Upon her throne, with stars bedight,
                  Enthralled my soul to thee!


     III.     Ah! ever I behold
                  Thy dreamy, passionate eyes,
                  Blue as the languid skies
              Hung with the sunset's fringe of gold;
              Now strangely clear thine image grows,
                  And olden memories
              Are startled from their long repose
              Like shadows on the silent snows
              When suddenly the night-wind blows
                  Where quiet moonlight lies.


     IV.      Like music heard in dreams,
                  Like strains of harps unknown,
                  Of birds for ever flown,--
              Audible as the voice of streams
              That murmur in some leafy dell,
                  I hear thy gentlest tone,
              And Silence cometh with her spell
              Like that which on my tongue doth dwell,
              When tremulous in dreams I tell
                  My love to thee alone!

     V.       In every valley heard,
                  Floating from tree to tree,
                  Less beautiful to me,
              The music of the radiant bird,
              Than artless accents such as thine
                  Whose echoes never flee!
              Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:--
              For uttered in thy tones benign
              (Enchantress!) this rude name of mine
                  Doth seem a melody!

     THE VILLAGE STREET.


       In these rapid, restless shadows,
         Once I walked at eventide,
       When a gentle, silent maiden,
         Walked in beauty at my side.
       She alone there walked beside me
       All in beauty, like a bride.

       Pallidly the moon was shining
         On the dewy meadows nigh;
       On the silvery, silent rivers,
         On the mountains far and high,--
       On the ocean's star-lit waters,
         Where the winds a-weary die.

       Slowly, silently we wandered
         From the open cottage door,
       Underneath the elm's long branches
         To the pavement bending o'er;
       Underneath the mossy willow
         And the dying sycamore.

       With the myriad stars in beauty
         All bedight, the heavens were seen,
       Radiant hopes were bright around me,
         Like the light of stars serene;
       Like the mellow midnight splendor
         Of the Night's irradiate queen.

       Audibly the elm-leaves whispered
         Peaceful, pleasant melodies,
       Like the distant murmured music
         Of unquiet, lovely seas;
       While the winds were hushed in slumber
         In the fragrant flowers and trees.

       Wondrous and unwonted beauty
         Still adorning all did seem,
       While I told my love in fables
         'Neath the willows by the stream;
       Would the heart have kept unspoken
         Love that was its rarest dream!

       Instantly away we wandered
         In the shadowy twilight tide,
       She, the silent, scornful maiden,
         Walking calmly at my side,
       With a step serene and stately,
         All in beauty, all in pride.

       Vacantly I walked beside her.
         On the earth mine eyes were cast;
       Swift and keen there came unto me
         Bitter memories of the past--
       On me, like the rain in Autumn
         On the dead leaves, cold and fast.

       Underneath the elms we parted,
         By the lowly cottage door;
       One brief word alone was uttered--
         Never on our lips before;
       And away I walked forlornly,
       Broken-hearted evermore.

       Slowly, silently I loitered,
         Homeward, in the night, alone;
       Sudden anguish bound my spirit,
         That my youth had never known;
       Wild unrest, like that which cometh
         When the Night's first dream hath flown.

       Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper
         Mad, discordant melodies,
       And keen melodies like shadows
         Haunt the moaning willow trees,
       And the sycamores with laughter
         Mock me in the nightly breeze.

       Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight
         Through the sighing foliage streams;
       And each morning, midnight shadow,
         Shadow of my sorrow seems;
       Strive, O heart, forget thine idol!
         And, O soul, forget thy dreams!





            *       *       *       *       *





     THE FOREST REVERIE.


           'Tis said that when
           The hands of men
         Tamed this primeval wood,
       And hoary trees with groans of wo,
       Like warriors by an unknown foe,
         Were in their strength subdued,
           The virgin Earth
           Gave instant birth
         To springs that ne'er did flow--
           That in the sun
           Did rivulets run,
       And all around rare flowers did blow--
           The wild rose pale
           Perfumed the gale,
       And the queenly lily adown the dale
           (Whom the sun and the dew
           And the winds did woo),
       With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.

           So when in tears
           The love of years
         Is wasted like the snow,
       And the fine fibrils of its life
       By the rude wrong of instant strife
         Are broken at a blow--
           Within the heart
           Do springs upstart
         Of which it doth now know,
           And strange, sweet dreams,
           Like silent streams
       That from new fountains overflow,
           With the earlier tide
           Of rivers glide
       Deep in the heart whose hope has died--
       Quenching the fires its ashes hide,--
         Its ashes, whence will spring and grow
           Sweet flowers, ere long,--
         The rare and radiant flowers of song!

     NOTES.


     Of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of Edgar Poe,
     and not included among his known writings, the lines entitled "Alone"
     have the chief claim to our notice. 'Fac-simile' copies of this piece
     had been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its
     publication in 'Scribner's Magazine' for September 1875; but as proofs
     of the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained from
     publishing it as requested. The desired proofs have not yet been
     adduced, and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to
     guide us. "Alone" is stated to have been written by Poe in the album of
     a Baltimore lady (Mrs. Balderstone?), on March 17th, 1829, and the
     'fac-simile' given in 'Scribner's' is alleged to be of his handwriting.
     If the caligraphy be Poe's, it is different in all essential respects
     from all the many specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of
     the writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which
     the contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added.
     The lines, however, if not by Poe, are the most successful imitation of
     his early mannerisms yet made public, and, in the opinion of one well
     qualified to speak, "are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage
     claimed for them."

     Whilst Edgar Poe was editor of the 'Broadway Journal', some lines "To
     Isadore" appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore
     no signature. They were at once ascribed to Poe, and in order to satisfy
     questioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared, saying they
     were by "A. Ide, junior." Two previous poems had appeared in the
     'Broadway Journal' over the signature of "A. M. Ide," and whoever wrote
     them was also the author of the lines "To Isadore." In order, doubtless,
     to give a show of variety, Poe was then publishing some of his known
     works in his journal over 'noms de plume', and as no other writings
     whatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of "A. M. Ide," it
     is not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may
     be by the author of "The Raven." Having been published without his usual
     elaborate revision, Poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an
     assumed name. The three pieces are included in the present collection,
     so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be
     by the author of "The Raven."

     THE ISLAND OF THE FAY.


         "Nullus enim locus sine genio est."

         _Servius_.


     "_La musique_," says Marmontel, in those "Contes Moraux"[1] which in all
     our translations we have insisted upon calling "Moral Tales," as if in
     mockery of their spirit--"_la musique est le seul des talens qui jouisse
     de lui-meme: tous les autres veulent des temoins_." He here confounds
     the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating
     them. No more than any other _talent_, is that for music susceptible of
     complete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its
     exercise; and it is only in common with other talents that it produces
     _effects_ which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which the
     _raconteur_ has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in
     its expression to his national love of _point_, is doubtless the very
     tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly
     estimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposition in this form
     will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and
     for its spiritual uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach
     of fallen mortality, and perhaps only one, which owes even more than
     does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the happiness
     experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth, the man
     who would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude
     behold that glory. To me at least the presence, not of human life only,
     but of life, in any other form than that of the green things which grow
     upon the soil and are voiceless, is a stain upon the landscape, is at
     war with the genius of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark
     valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the
     forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains
     that look down upon all,--I love to regard these as themselves but the
     colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole--a whole whose
     form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all;
     whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the
     moon; whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity; whose
     thought is that of a god; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies
     are lost in immensity; whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our
     own cognizance of the _animalculæ_ which infest the brain, a being which
     we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material, much in the
     same manner as these _animalculæ_ must thus regard us.

     Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every
     hand, notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood,
     that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in
     the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars move are those
     best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest
     possible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies are accurately such
     as within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of
     matter; while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate
     a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces
     otherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object
     with God that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of
     matter to fill it; and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter
     with vitality is a principle--indeed, as far as our judgments extend,
     the _leading_ principle in the operations of Deity, it is scarcely
     logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we
     daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august. As we find
     cycle within cycle without end, yet all revolving around one far-distant
     centre which is the Godhead, may we not analogically suppose, in the
     same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all
     within the Spirit Divine? In short, we are madly erring through
     self-esteem in believing man, in either his temporal or future
     destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast "clod of
     the valley" which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul,
     for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation
     [2].

     These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations
     among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a
     tinge of what the every-day world would not fail to term the fantastic.
     My wanderings amid such scenes have been many and far-searching, and
     often solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many
     a dim deep valley, or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright
     lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have
     strayed and gazed _alone._ What flippant Frenchman [3] was it who said,
     in allusion to the well known work of Zimmermann, that _"la solitude est
     une belle chose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitude
     est une belle chose"_? The epigram cannot be gainsaid; but the necessity
     is a thing that does not exist.

     It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of
     mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarns
     writhing or sleeping within all, that I chanced upon a certain rivulet
     and island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw
     myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,
     that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only
     should I look upon it, such was the character of phantasm which it wore.

     On all sides, save to the west where the sun was about sinking, arose
     the verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply
     in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no
     exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of
     the trees to the east; while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to
     me as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly
     and continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall
     from the sunset fountains of the sky.

     About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one
     small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the
     stream.

       So blended bank and shadow there,
       That each seemed pendulous in air--

     so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to
     say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal
     dominion began. My position enabled me to include in a single view both
     the eastern and western extremities of the islet, and I observed a
     singularly-marked difference in their aspects. The latter was all one
     radiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eye
     of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was
     short, springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees were
     lithe, mirthful, erect, bright, slender, and graceful, of eastern figure
     and foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed a
     deep sense of life and joy about all, and although no airs blew from out
     the heavens, yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings to
     and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for
     tulips with wings [4].

     The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.
     A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom, here pervaded all things.
     The trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude--
     wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, that
     conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the
     deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly,
     and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low
     and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were
     not, although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary
     clambered. The shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and
     seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element
     with darkness. I fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower
     and lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth,
     and thus became absorbed by the stream, while other shadows issued
     momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus
     entombed.

     This idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it, and I
     lost myself forthwith in reverie. "If ever island were enchanted," said
     I to myself, "this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who
     remain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?--or do
     they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In dying,
     do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God little by
     little their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,
     exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree is to
     the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys
     upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?"

     As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to
     rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing
     upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the
     sycamore, flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a
     quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased; while I
     thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays
     about whom I had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darkness
     from out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect in
     a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an
     oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude
     seemed indicative of joy, but sorrow deformed it as she passed within
     the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and
     re-entered the region of light. "The revolution which has just been made
     by the Fay," continued I musingly, "is the cycle of the brief year of
     her life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. She
     is a year nearer unto death: for I did not fail to see that as she came
     into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the
     dark water, making its blackness more black."

     And again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of the
     latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.
     She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened
     momently), and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and
     became absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made the
     circuit of the island (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and
     at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,
     while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each
     passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became
     whelmed in a shadow more black. But at length, when the sun had utterly
     departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went
     disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and
     that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over all
     things, and I beheld her magical figure no more.

     THE POWER OF WORDS.


     'Oinos.'

       Pardon, Agathos, the weakness of a spirit new-fledged with
       immortality!


     'Agathos.'

       You have spoken nothing, my Oinos, for which pardon is to be demanded.
       Not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition. For wisdom, ask of
       the angels freely, that it may be given!


     'Oinos.'

       But in this existence I dreamed that I should be at once cognizant of
       all things, and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all.


     'Agathos.'

       Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of
       knowledge! In forever knowing, we are forever blessed; but to know
       all, were the curse of a fiend.


     'Oinos.'

       But does not The Most High know all?


     'Agathos'.

       _That_ (since he is The Most Happy) must be still the _one_ thing
       unknown even to HIM.


     'Oinos.'

       But, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not _at last_ all things
       be known?


     'Agathos.'

       Look down into the abysmal distances!--attempt to force the gaze down
       the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them
       thus--and thus--and thus! Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all
       points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?--the
       walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has
       appeared to blend into unity?


     'Oinos'.

       I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream.


     'Agathos'.

       There are no dreams in Aidenn--but it is here whispered that, of this
       infinity of matter, the _sole_ purpose is to afford infinite springs
       at which the soul may allay the thirst _to know_ which is forever
       unquenchable within it--since to quench it would be to extinguish the
       soul's self. Question me then, my Oinos, freely and without fear.
       Come! we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the Pleiades, and
       swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion,
       where, for pansies and violets, and heart's-ease, are the beds of the
       triplicate and triple-tinted suns.


     'Oinos'.

       And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!--speak to me in the
       earth's familiar tones! I understand not what you hinted to me just
       now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were
       accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to say that the Creator is
       not God?


     'Agathos'.

       I mean to say that the Deity does not create.


     'Oinos'.

       Explain!


     'Agathos'.

       In the beginning only, he created. The seeming creatures which are now
       throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only
       be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or
       immediate results of the Divine creative power.


     'Oinos.'

       Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the
       extreme.


     'Agathos.'

       Among the angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.


     'Oinos.'

       I can comprehend you thus far--that certain operations of what we term
       Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise
       to that which has all the _appearance_ of creation. Shortly before the
       final overthrow of the earth, there were, I well remember, many very
       successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to
       denominate the creation of animalculæ.


     'Agathos.'

       The cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary
       creation, and of the _only_ species of creation which has ever been
       since the first word spoke into existence the first law.


     'Oinos.'

       Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst
       hourly forth into the heavens--are not these stars, Agathos, the
       immediate handiwork of the King?


     'Agathos.'

       Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the
       conception I intend. You are well aware that, as no thought can
       perish, so no act is without infinite result. We moved our hands, for
       example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave
       vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it. This vibration was
       indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the
       earth's air, which thenceforward, _and forever_, was actuated by the
       one movement of the hand. This fact the mathematicians of our globe
       well knew. They made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid
       by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation--so that it
       became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given
       extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (forever) every atom of the
       atmosphere circumambient. Retrograding, they found no difficulty; from
       a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of
       the original impulse. Now the mathematicians who saw that the results
       of any given impulse were absolutely endless--and who saw that a
       portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency
       of algebraic analysis--who saw, too, the facility of the
       retrogradation--these men saw, at the same time, that this species of
       analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite
       progress--that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and
       applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or
       applied it. But at this point our mathematicians paused.


     'Oinos.'

       And why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?


     'Agathos.'

       Because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond. It was
       deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite
       understanding--one to whom the _perfection_ of the algebraic analysis
       lay unfolded--there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse
       given the air--and the ether through the air--to the remotest
       consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time. It is indeed
       demonstrable that every such impulse _given the air_, must _in the
       end_ impress every individual thing that exists _within the
       universe;_--and the being of infinite understanding--the being whom
       we have imagined--might trace the remote undulations of the
       impulse--trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all
       particles of all matter--upward and onward forever in their
       modifications of old forms--or, in other words, _in their creation of
       new_--until he found them reflected--unimpressive _at last_--back from
       the throne of the Godhead. And not only could such a being do this,
       but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him--should one of
       these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his
       inspection--he could have no difficulty in determining, by the
       analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. This
       power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection--this
       faculty of referring at _all_ epochs, _all_ effects to _all_
       causes--is of course the prerogative of the Deity alone--but in every
       variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power
       itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic Intelligences.


     'Oinos'.

       But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.


     'Agathos'.

       In speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth: but the general
       proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether--which, since it
       pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of
       _creation_.


     'Oinos'.

       Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?


     'Agathos'.

       It must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all
       motion is thought--and the source of all thought is--


     'Oinos'.

       God.


     'Agathos'.

       I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child, of the fair Earth which
       lately perished--of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth.


     'Oinos'.

       You did.


     'Agathos'.

       And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of
       the _physical power of words_? Is not every word an impulse on the
       air?


     'Oinos'.

       But why, Agathos, do you weep--and why, oh, why do your wings droop as
       we hover above this fair star--which is the greenest and yet most
       terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? Its brilliant
       flowers look like a fairy dream--but its fierce volcanoes like the
       passions of a turbulent heart.


     'Agathos'.

       They _are_!--they _are_!--This wild star--it is now three centuries
       since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my
       beloved--I spoke it--with a few passionate sentences--into birth. Its
       brilliant flowers _are_ the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its
       raging volcanoes _are_ the passions of the most turbulent and
       unhallowed of hearts!

     THE COLLOQUY OF MONOS AND UNA.


       [Greek: Mellonta  sauta']

       These things are in the future.

       _Sophocles_--'Antig.'



     'Una.'

       "Born again?"


     'Monos.'

       Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, "born again." These were the words
       upon whose mystical meaning I had so long pondered, rejecting the
       explanations of the priesthood, until Death itself resolved for me the
       secret.


     'Una.'

       Death!


     'Monos.'

       How strangely, sweet _Una_, you echo my words! I observe, too, a
       vacillation in your step, a joyous inquietude in your eyes. You are
       confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the Life Eternal.
       Yes, it was of Death I spoke. And here how singularly sounds that word
       which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts, throwing a mildew
       upon all pleasures!


     'Una.'

       Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts! How often, Monos, did
       we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature! How mysteriously
       did it act as a check to human bliss, saying unto it, "thus far, and
       no farther!" That earnest mutual love, my own Monos, which burned
       within our bosoms, how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy
       in its first upspringing that our happiness would strengthen with its
       strength! Alas, as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that
       evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever! Thus in time it
       became painful to love. Hate would have been mercy then.


     'Monos'.

       Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una--mine, mine forever now!


     'Una'.

       But the memory of past sorrow, is it not present joy? I have much to
       say yet of the things which have been. Above all, I burn to know the
       incidents of your own passage through the dark Valley and Shadow.


     'Monos'.

       And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her Monos in vain? I will
       be minute in relating all, but at what point shall the weird narrative
       begin?


     'Una'.

       At what point?


     'Monos'.

       You have said.


     'Una'.

       Monos, I comprehend you. In Death we have both learned the propensity
       of man to define the indefinable. I will not say, then, commence with
       the moment of life's cessation--but commence with that sad, sad
       instant when, the fever having abandoned you, you sank into a
       breathless and motionless torpor, and I pressed down your pallid
       eyelids with the passionate fingers of love.


     'Monos'.

       One word first, my Una, in regard to man's general condition at this
       epoch. You will remember that one or two of the wise among our
       forefathers--wise in fact, although not in the world's esteem--had
       ventured to doubt the propriety of the term "improvement," as applied
       to the progress of our civilization. There were periods in each of the
       five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose
       some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose
       truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious
       --principles which should have taught our race to submit to the
       guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control. At
       long intervals some master-minds appeared, looking upon each advance
       in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility.
       Occasionally the poetic intellect--that intellect which we now feel to
       have been the most exalted of all--since those truths which to us were
       of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that
       _analogy_ which speaks in proof-tones to the imagination alone, and to
       the unaided reason bears no weight--occasionally did this poetic
       intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of
       the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree
       of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct
       intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition
       of his soul. And these men--the poets--living and perishing amid the
       scorn of the "utilitarians"--of rough pedants, who arrogated to
       themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the
       scorned--these men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely,
       upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our
       enjoyments were keen--days when _mirth_ was a word unknown, so
       solemnly deep-toned was happiness--holy, august, and blissful days,
       blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest
       solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored. Yet these noble
       exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by
       opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil
       days. The great "movement"--that was the cant term--went on: a
       diseased commotion, moral and physical. Art--the Arts--arose supreme,
       and once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated
       them to power. Man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty
       of Nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and
       still-increasing dominion over her elements. Even while he stalked a
       God in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him. As might
       be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with
       system, and with abstraction. He enwrapped himself in generalities.
       Among other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and
       in the face of analogy and of God--in despite of the loud warning
       voice of the laws of _gradation_ so visibly pervading all things in
       Earth and Heaven--wild attempts at an omniprevalent Democracy were
       made. Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil,
       Knowledge. Man could not both know and succumb. Meantime huge smoking
       cities arose, innumerable. Green leaves shrank before the hot breath
       of furnaces. The fair face of Nature was deformed as with the ravages
       of some loathsome disease. And methinks, sweet Una, even our
       slumbering sense of the forced and of the far-fetched might have
       arrested us here. But now it appears that we had worked out our own
       destruction in the perversion of our _taste_, or rather in the blind
       neglect of its culture in the schools. For, in truth, it was at this
       crisis that taste alone--that faculty which, holding a middle position
       between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely
       have been disregarded--it was now that taste alone could have led us
       gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to Life. But alas for the pure
       contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of Plato! Alas for the
       [Greek: mousichae]  which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient
       education for the soul! Alas for him and for it!--since both were most
       desperately needed, when both were most entirely forgotten or despised
       [1]. Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how
       truly!--"_Que tout notre raisonnement se réduit à céder au
       sentiment;_" and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the
       natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old ascendency
       over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools. But this thing was
       not to be. Prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge, the old
       age of the world drew near. This the mass of mankind saw not, or,
       living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see. But, for
       myself, the Earth's records had taught me to look for widest ruin as
       the price of highest civilization. I had imbibed a prescience of our
       Fate from comparison of China the simple and enduring, with Assyria
       the architect, with Egypt the astrologer, with Nubia, more crafty than
       either, the turbulent mother of all Arts. In the history of these
       regions I met with a ray from the Future. The individual
       artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the Earth,
       and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied;
       but for the infected world at large I could anticipate no regeneration
       save in death. That man, as a race, should not become extinct, I saw
       that he must be "_born again._"

       And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,
       daily, in dreams. Now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the
       days to come, when the Art-scarred surface of the Earth, having
       undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular
       obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the
       mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of Paradise, and be rendered at
       length a fit dwelling-place for man:--for man the Death-purged--for
       man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge
       no more--for the redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal,
       but still for the _material_, man.


     'Una'.

       Well do I remember these conversations, dear Monos; but the epoch of
       the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the
       corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing. Men lived;
       and died individually. You yourself sickened, and passed into the
       grave; and thither your constant Una speedily followed you. And though
       the century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings up
       together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience
       of duration, yet my Monos, it was a century still.


     'Monos'.

       Say, rather, a point in the vague infinity. Unquestionably, it was in
       the Earth's dotage that I died. Wearied at heart with anxieties which
       had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, I succumbed to the
       fierce fever. After some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium
       replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for
       pain, while I longed but was impotent to undeceive you--after some
       days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless
       torpor; and this was termed _Death_ by those who stood around me.

       Words are vague things. My condition did not deprive me of sentience.
       It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of
       him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and
       fully prostrate in a mid-summer noon, begins to steal slowly back into
       consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without
       being awakened by external disturbances.

       I breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The heart had ceased to
       beat. Volition had not departed, but was powerless. The senses were
       unusually active, although eccentrically so--assuming often each
       other's functions at random. The taste and the smell were inextricably
       confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense. The
       rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the
       last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers--fantastic flowers,
       far more lovely than any of the old Earth, but whose prototypes we
       have here blooming around us. The eye-lids, transparent and bloodless,
       offered no complete impediment to vision. As volition was in abeyance,
       the balls could not roll in their sockets--but all objects within the
       range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less
       distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into
       the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which
       struck the front or interior surface. Yet, in the former instance,
       this effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it only as
       _sound_--sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting
       themselves at my side were light or dark in shade--curved or angular
       in outline. The hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree,
       was not irregular in action--estimating real sounds with an
       extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility. Touch had
       undergone a modification more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily
       received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the
       highest physical pleasure. Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers
       upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length,
       long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight
       immeasurable. I say with a sensual delight. _All_ my perceptions were
       purely sensual. The materials furnished the passive brain by the
       senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased
       understanding. Of pain there was some little; of pleasure there was
       much; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all. Thus your wild sobs
       floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were
       appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but they were soft
       musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no
       intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while large and
       constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a
       heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy
       alone. And this was in truth the _Death_ of which these bystanders
       spoke reverently, in low whispers--you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with
       loud cries.

       They attired me for the coffin--three or four dark figures which
       flitted busily to and fro. As these crossed the direct line of my
       vision they affected me as _forms;_ but upon passing to my side their
       images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and, other
       dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of woe. You alone, habited
       in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about.

       The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed by a
       vague uneasiness--an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real
       sounds fall continuously within his ear--low distant bell-tones,
       solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy
       dreams. Night arrived; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort. It
       oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was
       palpable. There was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant
       reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the
       first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness. Suddenly
       lights were brought into the rooms, and this reverberation became
       forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound,
       but less dreary and less distinct. The ponderous oppression was in a
       great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp (for
       there were many), there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of
       melodious monotone. And when now, dear Una, approaching the bed upon
       which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor
       from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose
       tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical
       sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to
       sentiment itself--a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded
       to your earnest love and sorrow; but this feeling took no root in the
       pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and
       faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a
       purely sensual pleasure as before.

       And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there
       appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. In its
       exercise I found a wild delight--yet a delight still physical,
       inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part. Motion in the animal
       frame had fully ceased. No muscle quivered; no nerve thrilled; no
       artery throbbed. But there seemed to have sprung up in the brain
       _that_ of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence
       even an indistinct conception. Let me term it a mental pendulous
       pulsation. It was the moral embodiment of man's abstract idea of
       _Time_. By the absolute equalization of this movement--or of such as
       this--had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted.
       By its aid I measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel,
       and of the watches of the attendants. Their tickings came sonorously
       to my ears. The slightest deviations from the true proportion--and
       these deviations were omniprevalent--affected me just as violations of
       abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense. Although
       no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds
       accurately together, yet I had no difficulty in holding steadily in
       mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each. And
       this--this keen, perfect self-existing sentiment of _duration_--this
       sentiment existing (as man could not possibly have conceived it to
       exist) independently of any succession of events--this idea--this
       sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first
       obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of
       the temporal eternity.

       It was midnight; and you still sat by my side. All others had departed
       from the chamber of Death. They had deposited me in the coffin. The
       lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the tremulousness of the
       monotonous strains. But suddenly these strains diminished in
       distinctness and in volume. Finally they ceased. The perfume in my
       nostrils died away. Forms affected my vision no longer. The oppression
       of the Darkness uplifted itself from my bosom. A dull shot like that
       of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of
       the idea of contact. All of what man has termed sense was merged in
       the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of
       duration. The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of
       the deadly _Decay_.

       Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and the
       sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic
       intuition. I appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the
       flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence
       of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una, I still dully felt that you
       sat by my side. So, too, when the noon of the second day came, I was
       not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side,
       which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the
       hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which
       heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness
       and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.

       And here in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose, there
       rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched narrowly
       each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its
       flight--without effort and without object.

       A year passed. The consciousness of _being_ had grown hourly more
       indistinct, and that of mere _locality_ had in great measure usurped
       its position. The idea of entity was becoming merged in that of
       _place_. The narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the
       body was now growing to be the body itself. At length, as often
       happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is _Death_
       imaged)--at length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the deep
       slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking,
       yet left him half enveloped in dreams--so to me, in the strict embrace
       of the _Shadow_, came _that_ light which alone might have had power to
       startle--the light of enduring _Love_. Men toiled at the grave in
       which I lay darkling. They upthrew the damp earth. Upon my mouldering
       bones there descended the coffin of Una. And now again all was void.
       That nebulous light had been extinguished. That feeble thrill had
       vibrated itself into quiescence. Many _lustra_ had supervened. Dust
       had returned to dust. The worm had food no more. The sense of being
       had at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead--
       instead of all things, dominant and perpetual--the autocrats _Place_
       and _Time._ For _that_ which _was not_--for that which had no
       form--for that which had no thought--for that which had no
       sentience--for that which was soundless, yet of which matter formed no
       portion--for all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the
       grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates.

       "For this reason is a musical education most essential; since it
       causes Rhythm and Harmony to penetrate most intimately into the soul,
       taking the strongest hold upon it, filling it with _beauty_ and making
       the man _beautiful-minded_. ... He will praise and admire _the
       beautiful_, will receive it with joy into his soul, will feed upon it,
       and _assimilate his own condition with it_."

     comprehensive signification than with us. It included not only the
     harmonies of time and of tune, but the poetic diction, sentiment and
     creation, each in its widest sense. The study of _music_ was with them,
     in fact, the general cultivation of the taste--of that which recognizes
     the beautiful--in contradistinction from reason, which deals only with
     the true.]

     THE CONVERSATION OF EIROS AND CHARMION.


       I will bring fire to thee.

       _Euripides_.--'Androm'.



     'Eiros'.

       Why do you call me Eiros?


     'Charmion'.

       So henceforward will you always be called. You must forget, too, _my_
       earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion.


     'Eiros'.

       This is indeed no dream!


     'Charmion'.

       Dreams are with us no more;--but of these mysteries anon. I rejoice to
       see you looking life-like and rational. The film of the shadow has
       already passed from off your eyes. Be of heart, and fear nothing. Your
       allotted days of stupor have expired, and to-morrow I will myself
       induct you into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence.


     'Eiros'.

       True--I feel no stupor--none at all. The wild sickness and the
       terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no longer that mad,
       rushing, horrible sound, like the "voice of many waters." Yet my
       senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their perception
       of _the new_.


     'Charmion'.

       A few days will remove all this;--but I fully understand you, and
       feel for you. It is now ten earthly years since I underwent what you
       undergo--yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still. You have now
       suffered all of pain, however, which you will suffer in Aidenn.


     'Eiros'.

       In Aidenn?


     'Charmion'.

       In Aidenn.


     'Eiros'.

       O God!--pity me, Charmion!--I am overburthened with the majesty of all
       things--of the unknown now known--of the speculative Future merged in
       the august and certain Present.


     'Charmion'.

       Grapple not now with such thoughts. To-morrow we will speak of this.
       Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise
       of simple memories. Look not around, nor forward--but back. I am
       burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event
       which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let us converse of familiar
       things, in the old familiar language of the world which has so
       fearfully perished.


     'Eiros'.

       Most fearfully, fearfully!--this is indeed no dream.


     'Charmion'.

       Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?

     'Eiros'.

       Mourned, Charmion?--oh, deeply. To that last hour of all there hung a
       cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household.


     'Charmion'.

       And that last hour--speak of it. Remember that, beyond the naked fact
       of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When, coming out from among
       mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave--at that period, if I
       remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly
       unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the speculative
       philosophy of the day.


     'Eiros'.

       The individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated; but
       analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with
       astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you
       left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy
       writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as
       having reference to the orb of the earth alone, But in regard to the
       immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that
       epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of
       the terrors of flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had
       been well established. They had been observed to pass among the
       satellites of Jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration
       either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We
       had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable
       tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our
       substantial globe, even in the event of contact. But contact was not
       in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets were
       accurately known. That among _them_ we should look for the agency of
       the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an
       inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild fancies had been of late days
       strangely rife among mankind; and, although it was only with a few of
       the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement
       by astronomers of a _new_ comet, yet this announcement was generally
       received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust.

       The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it
       was at once conceded by all observers that its path, at perihelion
       would bring it into very close proximity with the earth. There were
       two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained
       that a contact was inevitable. I cannot very well express to you the
       effect of this intelligence upon the people. For a few short days they
       would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed
       among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp. But the
       truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the
       understanding of even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that
       astronomical knowledge lies not, and they awaited the comet. Its
       approach was not at first seemingly rapid, nor was its appearance of
       very unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little
       perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material increase
       in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color.
       Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interest
       absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in
       respect to the cometary nature. Even the grossly ignorant aroused
       their sluggish capacities to such considerations. The learned _now_
       gave their intellect--their soul--to no such points as the allaying of
       fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory. They sought--they panted
       for right views. They groaned for perfected knowledge. _Truth_ arose
       in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise
       bowed down and adored.

       That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result
       from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground
       among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the
       reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was demonstrated that the
       density of the comet's _nucleus_ was far less than that of our rarest
       gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the
       satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which
       served greatly to allay terror. Theologists, with an earnestness
       fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them
       to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous
       instance had been known. That the final destruction of the earth must
       be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that
       enforced everywhere conviction; and that the comets were of no fiery
       nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a
       great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold.
       It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in
       regard to pestilences and wars--errors which were wont to prevail upon
       every appearance of a comet--were now altogether unknown, as if by
       some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition
       from her throne. The feeblest intellect had derived vigor from
       excessive interest.

       What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate
       question. The learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of
       probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation; of
       possible magnetic and electric influences. Many held that no visible
       or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced. While such
       discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing
       larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. Mankind
       grew paler as it came. All human operations were suspended.

       There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the
       comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any
       previously recorded visitation. The people now, dismissing any
       lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the
       certainty of evil. The chimerical aspect of their terror was gone. The
       hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms.
       A very few days suffered, however, to merge even such feelings in
       sentiments more unendurable. We could no longer apply to the strange
       orb any _accustomed_ thoughts. Its _historical_ attributes had
       disappeared. It oppressed us with a hideous _novelty_ of emotion. We
       saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an
       incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains. It had taken,
       with unconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of
       rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon.

       Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear that we
       were already within the influence of the comet; yet we lived. We even
       felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind. The
       exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent; for all
       heavenly objects were plainly visible through it. Meantime, our
       vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we gained faith, from this
       predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise. A wild
       luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every
       vegetable thing.

       Yet another day--and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was now
       evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change had come
       over all men; and the first sense of _pain_ was the wild signal for
       general lamentation and horror. The first sense of pain lay in a
       rigorous construction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable
       dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that our atmosphere was
       radically affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the
       possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the
       topics of discussion. The result of investigation sent an electric
       thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man.

       It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound
       of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures
       of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the
       atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the
       vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal
       life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature.
       Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal
       life or flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been
       ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had
       latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea,
       which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a _total
       extraction of the nitrogen_? A combustion irresistible, all-devouring,
       omni-prevalent, immediate;--the entire fulfilment, in all their
       minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring
       denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.

       Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind?
       That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope,
       was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In its impalpable
       gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate.
       Meantime a day again passed--bearing away with it the last shadow of
       Hope. We gasped in the rapid modification of the air. The red blood
       bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. A furious delirium
       possessed all men; and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the
       threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus
       of the destroyer was now upon us;--even here in Aidenn I shudder while
       I speak. Let me be brief--brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a
       moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating
       all things. Then--let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive
       majesty of the great God!--then, there came a shouting and pervading
       sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM; while the whole incumbent
       mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of
       intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat
       even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name.
       Thus ended all.

     SHADOW.--A PARABLE.


         Yea! though I walk through the valley of the _Shadow_.

         'Psalm of David'.


     Ye who read are still among the living; but I who write shall have long
     since gone my way into the region of shadows. For indeed strange things
     shall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass
     away, ere these memorials be seen of men. And, when seen, there will be
     some to disbelieve and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much
     to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.

     The year had been a year of terror, and of feeling more intense than
     terror for which there is no name upon the earth. For many prodigies and
     signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black
     wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad. To those, nevertheless,
     cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect
     of ill; and to me, the Greek Oinos, among others, it was evident that
     now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth
     year when, at the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is enjoined with
     the red ring of the terrible Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the skies,
     if I mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical
     orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of
     mankind.

     Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a noble
     hall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of
     seven. And to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of
     brass: and the door was fashioned by the artisan Corinnos, and, being of
     rare workmanship, was fastened from within. Black draperies, likewise in
     the gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and
     the peopleless streets--but the boding and the memory of Evil, they
     would not be so excluded. There were things around us and about of which
     I can render no distinct account--things material and spiritual--
     heaviness in the atmosphere--a sense of suffocation--anxiety--and, above
     all, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when
     the senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of
     thought lie dormant. A dead weight hung upon us. It hung upon our
     limbs--upon the household furniture--upon the goblets from which we
     drank; and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby--all things
     save only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel.
     Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained
     burning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror which their lustre
     formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us there
     assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet
     glare in the downcast eyes of his companions. Yet we laughed and were
     merry in our proper way--which was hysterical; and sang the songs of
     Anacreon--which are madness; and drank deeply--although the purple wine
     reminded us of blood. For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in
     the person of young Zoilus. Dead and at full length he lay,
     enshrouded;--the genius and the demon of the scene. Alas! he bore no
     portion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the
     plague, and his eyes in which Death had but half extinguished the fire
     of the pestilence, seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as
     the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die. But
     although I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me,
     still I forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their
     expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony
     mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of
     Teos. But gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar
     off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and
     undistinguishable, and so faded away. And lo! from among those sable
     draperies, where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a
     dark and undefiled shadow--a shadow such as the moon, when low in
     heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow
     neither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. And quivering
     awhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view
     upon the surface of the door of brass. But the shadow was vague, and
     formless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor
     God--neither God of Greece, nor God of Chaldæa, nor any Egyptian God.
     And the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the
     entablature of the door and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there
     became stationary and remained. And the door whereupon the shadow rested
     was, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young Zoilus
     enshrouded. But we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as
     it came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but
     cast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror
     of ebony. And at length I, Oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of
     the shadow its dwelling and its appellation. And the shadow answered, "I
     am SHADOW, and my dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and
     hard by those dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul
     Charonian canal." And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in
     horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast: for the tones
     in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a
     multitude of beings, and varying in their cadences from syllable to
     syllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar
     accents of many thousand departed friends.





            *       *       *       *       *





     SILENCE.--A FABLE.


     The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags, and caves _are silent_.

     "LISTEN to _me_," said the Demon, as he placed his hand upon my head.
     "The region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders
     of the river Zäire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.

     "The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flow
     not onward to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red
     eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many miles
     on either side of the river's oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic
     water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch
     towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro
     their everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur which cometh
     out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water. And they sigh
     one unto the other.

     "But there is a boundary to their realm--the boundary of the dark,
     horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the
     low underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughout
     the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and
     thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits,
     one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots, strange poisonous
     flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling
     and loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll,
     a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind
     throughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zäire there is
     neither quiet nor silence.

     "It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain, but, having
     fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall lilies,
     and the rain fell upon my head--and the lilies sighed one unto the other
     in the solemnity of their desolation.

     "And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was
     crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood
     by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon. And
     the rock was gray and ghastly, and tall,--and the rock was gray. Upon
     its front were characters engraven in the stones; and I walked through
     the morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I
     might read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decipher them.
     And I was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller
     red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the
     characters;--and the characters were DESOLATION.

     "And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the
     rock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the
     action of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and wrapped
     up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And the
     outlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were the
     features of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and
     of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his
     face. And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care;
     and in the few furrows upon his cheek, I read the fables of sorrow, and
     weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.

     "And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and
     looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet
     shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the
     rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close within
     shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the man
     trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the
     rock.

     "And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon
     the dreary river Zäire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the
     pale legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs of
     the water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And I
     lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the
     man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the
     rock.

     "Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in
     among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami
     which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And the
     hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of
     the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay
     close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man
     trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the
     rock.

     "Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful
     tempest gathered in the heaven, where before there had been no wind. And
     the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest--and the rain
     beat upon the head of the man--and the floods of the river came
     down--and the river was tormented into foam--and the water-lilies
     shrieked within their beds--and the forest crumbled before the wind--and
     the thunder rolled--and the lightning fell--and the rock rocked to its
     foundation. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of
     the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and
     he sat upon the rock.

     "Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and
     the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the
     thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed,
     and _were still._ And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to
     heaven--and the thunder died away--and the lightning did not flash--and
     the clouds hung motionless--and the waters sunk to their level and
     remained--and the trees ceased to rock--and the water-lilies sighed no
     more--and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow
     of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the
     characters of the rock, and they were changed;--and the characters were
     SILENCE.

     "And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance
     was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand,
     and stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voice
     throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock
     were SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled
     afar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more."

     ...

     Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi--in the iron-bound,
     melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious histories
     of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty Sea--and of the Genii
     that overruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There was
     much lore, too, in the sayings which were said by the sybils; and holy,
     holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around
     Dodona--but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the demon told me as he
     sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most
     wonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell
     back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh
     with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynx
     which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at
     the feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.

     THE POETIC PRINCIPLE.


     In speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either
     thorough or profound. While discussing very much at random the
     essentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to
     cite for consideration some few of those minor English or American poems
     which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the
     most definite impression. By "minor poems" I mean, of course, poems of
     little length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words
     in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or
     wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of
     the poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the
     phrase, "a long poem," is simply a flat contradiction in terms.

     I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as
     it excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio
     of this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal
     necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a
     poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a
     composition of any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the
     very utmost, it flags--fails--a revulsion ensues--and then the poem is,
     in effect, and in fact, no longer such.

     There are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the
     critical dictum that the "Paradise Lost" is to be devoutly admired
     throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it,
     during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum
     would demand. This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical
     only when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art,
     Unity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its
     Unity--its totality of effect or impression--we read it (as would be
     necessary) at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation
     of excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true
     poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no
     critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the
     work, we read it again; omitting the first book--that is to say,
     commencing with the second--we shall be surprised at now finding that
     admirable which we before condemned--that damnable which we had
     previously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate,
     aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a
     nullity--and this is precisely the fact.

     In regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very
     good reason, for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but,
     granting the epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an
     imperfect sense of Art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious
     ancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day
     of these artistic anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem
     _were_ popular in reality--which I doubt--it is at least clear that no
     very long poem will ever be popular again.

     That the extent of a poetical work is _ceteris paribus_, the measure of
     its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition
     sufficiently absurd--yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly
     Reviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere _size_, abstractly
     considered--there can be nothing in mere _bulk_, so far as a volume is
     concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these
     saturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of
     physical magnitude which it conveys, _does_ impress us with a sense of
     the sublime--but no man is impressed after _this_ fashion by the
     material grandeur of even "The Columbiad." Even the Quarterlies have not
     instructed us to be so impressed by it. _As yet_, they have not
     _insisted_ on our estimating Lamartine by the cubic foot, or Pollock by
     the pound--but what else are we to _infer_ from their continual prating
     about "sustained effort"? If, by "sustained effort," any little
     gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the
     effort--if this indeed be a thing commendable--but let us forbear
     praising the epic on the effort's account. It is to be hoped thai common
     sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art
     rather by the impression it makes--by the effect it produces--than by
     the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of "sustained
     effort" which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The
     fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another--nor
     can all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this
     proposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received
     as self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as
     falsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths.

     On the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief.
     Undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A _very_ short poem,
     while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a
     profound or enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of
     the stamp upon the wax. De Béranger has wrought innumerable things,
     pungent and spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too
     imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and
     thus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be
     whistled down the wind.

     A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a
     poem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the
     following exquisite little Serenade:


       I arise from dreams of thee
         In the first sweet sleep of night
       When the winds are breathing low,
         And the stars are shining bright.
       I arise from dreams of thee,
         And a spirit in my feet
       Has led me--who knows how?--
         To thy chamber-window, sweet!

       The wandering airs they faint
         On the dark the silent stream--
       The champak odors fail
         Like sweet thoughts in a dream;
       The nightingale's complaint,
         It dies upon her heart,
       As I must die on thine,
         O, beloved as thou art!

       O, lift me from the grass!
         I die, I faint, I fail!
       Let thy love in kisses rain
         On my lips and eyelids pale.
       My cheek is cold and white, alas!
         My heart beats loud and fast:
       O, press it close to thine again,
         Where it will break at last!


     Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines, yet no less a poet than
     Shelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal
     imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by
     him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in
     the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.

     One of the finest poems by Willis, the very best in my opinion which he
     has ever written, has no doubt, through this same defect of undue
     brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the
     critical than in the popular view:


       The shadows lay along Broadway,
         'Twas near the twilight-tide--
       And slowly there a lady fair
         Was walking in her pride.
       Alone walk'd she; but, viewlessly
         Walk'd spirits at her side.

       Peace charm'd the street beneath her feet,
         And honor charm'd the air;
       And all astir looked kind on her,
         And called her good as fair--
       For all God ever gave to her
         She kept with chary care.

       She kept with care her beauties rare
         From lovers warm and true--
       For heart was cold to all but gold,
         And the rich came not to woo--
       But honor'd well her charms to sell,
         If priests the selling do.

       Now walking there was one more fair--
         A slight girl, lily-pale;
       And she had unseen company
         To make the spirit quail--
       Twixt Want and Scorn she walk'd forlorn,
         And nothing could avail.

       No mercy now can clear her brow
         From this world's peace to pray,
       For as love's wild prayer dissolved in air,
         Her woman's heart gave way!--
       But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven,
         By man is cursed alway!


     In this composition we find it difficult to recognise the Willis who has
     written so many mere "verses of society." The lines are not only richly
     ideal but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident
     sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the
     other works of this author.

     While the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity
     is indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of
     the public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded
     by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in
     the brief period it has already endured, may be said to have
     accomplished more in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all
     its other enemies combined. I allude to the heresy of _The Didactic_. It
     has been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that
     the ultimate object of all Poetry is truth. Every poem, it is said,
     should inculcate a moral, and by this moral is the poetical merit of the
     work to be adjudged. We Americans especially have patronized this happy
     idea, and we Bostonians very especially have developed it in full. We
     have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem's
     sake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to
     confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and
     force:--but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to
     look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under
     the sun there neither exists nor _can_ exist any work more thoroughly
     dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem _per
     se_, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written
     solely for the poem's sake.

     With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man,
     I would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I
     would limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation.
     The demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles.
     All _that_ which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all _that_
     with which _she_ has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a
     flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a
     truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be
     simple, precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word,
     we must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact
     converse of the poetical. _He_ must be blind indeed who does not
     perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the
     poetical modes of inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption
     who, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to
     reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.

     Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious
     distinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I
     place Taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the
     mind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but
     from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that
     Aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the
     virtues themselves. Nevertheless we find the _offices_ of the trio
     marked with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns
     itself with Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral
     Sense is regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the
     obligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with
     displaying the charms, waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of her
     deformity, her disproportion, her animosity to the fitting, to the
     appropriate, to the harmonious, in a word, to Beauty.

     An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a
     sense of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in
     the manifold forms, and sounds, and odors, and sentiments amid which he
     exists. And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of
     Amaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of
     these forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a
     duplicate source of delight. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He
     who shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however
     vivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and
     colors, and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind--he, I
     say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a
     something in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have
     still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the
     crystal springs. This thirst belongs to the immortality of man. It is at
     once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence. It is
     the desire of the moth for the star. It is no mere appreciation of the
     Beauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired
     by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle
     by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time to
     attain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhaps
     appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by Poetry, or when by Music,
     the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into
     tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina supposes, through excess
     of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our
     inability to grasp _now_, wholly, here on earth, at once and forever,
     those divine and rapturous joys of which _through_ the poem, or
     _through_ the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses.

     The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness--this struggle, on the
     part of souls fittingly constituted--has given to the world all _that_
     which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to understand and _to
     feel_ as poetic.

     The Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes--in
     Painting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance--very especially
     in Music--and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the composition
     of the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has regard only to
     its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly on the topic
     of rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music, in its
     various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in
     Poetry as never to be wisely rejected--is so vitally important an
     adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not
     now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps
     that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired
     by the poetic Sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal Beauty.
     It _may_ be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and, then,
     attained in _fact._ We are often made to feel, with a shivering delight,
     that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which _cannot_ have been
     unfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in the
     union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the
     widest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers
     had advantages which we do not possess--and Thomas Moore, singing his
     own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.

     To recapitulate then:--I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as
     _The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty._ Its sole arbiter is Taste. With the
     Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations.
     Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with Duty or with
     Truth.

     A few words, however, in explanation. _That_ pleasure which is at once
     the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, I
     maintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation
     of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable
     elevation, or excitement _of the soul_, which we recognize as the Poetic
     Sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the
     satisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of
     the heart. I make Beauty, therefore--using the word as inclusive of the
     sublime--I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an
     obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as directly as
     possible from their causes:--no one as yet having been weak enough to
     deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least _most readily_
     attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that the
     incitements of Passion, or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons of
     Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they
     may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the
     work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in
     proper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the real
     essence of the poem.

     I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your
     consideration, than by the citation of the Pröem to Longfellow's "Waif":


       The day is done, and the darkness
         Falls from the wings of Night,
       As a feather is wafted downward
         From an eagle in his flight.

       I see the lights of the village
         Gleam through the rain and the mist,
       And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,
         That my soul cannot resist;

       A feeling of sadness and longing,
         That is not akin to pain,
       And resembles sorrow only
         As the mist resembles the rain.

       Come, read to me some poem,
         Some simple and heartfelt lay,
       That shall soothe this restless feeling,
         And banish the thoughts of day.

       Not from the grand old masters,
         Not from the bards sublime,
       Whose distant footsteps echo
         Through the corridors of Time.

       For, like strains of martial music,
         Their mighty thoughts suggest
       Life's endless toil and endeavor;
         And to-night I long for rest.

       Read from some humbler poet,
         Whose songs gushed from his heart,
       As showers from the clouds of summer,
         Or tears from the eyelids start;

       Who through long days of labor,
         And nights devoid of ease,
       Still heard in his soul the music
         Of wonderful melodies.

       Such songs have power to quiet
         The restless pulse of care,
       And come like the benediction
         That follows after prayer.

       Then read from the treasured volume
         The poem of thy choice,
       And lend to the rhyme of the poet
         The beauty of thy voice.

       And the night shall be filled with music,
         And the cares that infest the day,
       Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,
         And as silently steal away.


     With no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired
     for their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective.
     Nothing can be better than


                --the bards sublime,
         Whose distant footsteps echo
       Down the corridors of Time.


     The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the
     whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful _insouciance_
     of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the
     sentiments, and especially for the _ease_ of the general manner. This
     "ease" or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion
     to regard as ease in appearance alone--as a point of really difficult
     attainment. But not so:--a natural manner is difficult only to him who
     should never meddle with it--to the unnatural. It is but the result of
     writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that _the tone_,
     in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would
     adopt--and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion. The
     author who, after the fashion of _The North American Review_, should be
     upon _all_ occasions merely "quiet," must necessarily upon _many_
     occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be
     considered "easy" or "natural" than a Cockney exquisite, or than the
     sleeping Beauty in the waxworks.

     Among the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the
     one which he entitles "June." I quote only a portion of it:


       There, through the long, long summer hours,
         The golden light should lie,
       And thick young herbs and groups of flowers
         Stand in their beauty by.
       The oriole should build and tell
       His love-tale, close beside my cell;
         The idle butterfly
       Should rest him there, and there be heard
       The housewife-bee and humming bird.

       And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,
         Come, from the village sent,
       Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,
         With fairy laughter blent?
       And what if, in the evening light,
       Betrothed lovers walk in sight
         Of my low monument?
       I would the lovely scene around
       Might know no sadder sight nor sound.

       I know, I know I should not see
         The season's glorious show,
       Nor would its brightness shine for me;
         Nor its wild music flow;

       But if, around my place of sleep,
       The friends I love should come to weep,
         They might not haste to go.
       Soft airs and song, and light and bloom,
       Should keep them lingering by my tomb.

       These to their soften'd hearts should bear
         The thought of what has been,
       And speak of one who cannot share
         The gladness of the scene;
       Whose part in all the pomp that fills
       The circuit of the summer hills,
         Is--that his grave is green;
       And deeply would their hearts rejoice
       To hear again his living voice.


     The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous--nothing could be more
     melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The
     intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of
     all the poet's cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to
     the soul--while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The
     impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the
     remaining compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or
     less of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or
     why we know not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected
     with all the higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,


       A feeling of sadness and longing
         That is not akin to pain,
       And resembles sorrow only
         As the mist resembles the rain.


     The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full
     of brilliancy and spirit as "The Health" of Edward Coote Pinkney:


       I fill this cup to one made up
         Of loveliness alone,
       A woman, of her gentle sex
         The seeming paragon;
       To whom the better elements
         And kindly stars have given
       A form so fair, that like the air,
         'Tis less of earth than heaven.

       Her every tone is music's own,
         Like those of morning birds,
       And something more than melody
         Dwells ever in her words;
       The coinage of her heart are they,
         And from her lips each flows
       As one may see the burden'd bee
         Forth issue from the rose.

       Affections are as thoughts to her,
         The measures of her hours;
       Her feelings have the fragrancy,
         The freshness of young flowers;
       And lovely passions, changing oft,
         So fill her, she appears
       The image of themselves by turns,--
         The idol of past years!

       Of her bright face one glance will trace
         A picture on the brain,
       And of her voice in echoing hearts
         A sound must long remain;
       But memory, such as mine of her,
         So very much endears,
       When death is nigh my latest sigh
         Will not be life's, but hers.

       I fill'd this cup to one made up
         Of loveliness alone,
       A woman, of her gentle sex
         The seeming paragon--
       Her health! and would on earth there stood,
         Some more of such a frame,
       That life might be all poetry,
         And weariness a name.


     It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinkney to have been born too far south.
     Had he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been
     ranked as the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which
     has so long controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting
     the thing called 'The North American Review'. The poem just cited is
     especially beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must
     refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet's enthusiasm. We pardon his
     hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered.

     It was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the _merits_
     of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for themselves.
     Boccalina, in his 'Advertisements from Parnassus', tells us that Zoilus
     once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable
     book:--whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work. He
     replied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing this,
     Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out _all
     the chaff_ for his reward.

     Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics--but I am by no
     means sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that
     the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood.
     Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an
     axiom, which need only be properly _put_, to become self-evident. It is
     _not_ excellence if it require to be demonstrated its such:--and thus to
     point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to admit that
     they are _not_ merits altogether.

     Among the "Melodies" of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished
     character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of
     view. I allude to his lines beginning--"Come, rest in this bosom." The
     intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in
     Byron. There are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that
     embodies the _all in all_ of the divine passion of Love--a sentiment
     which, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate,
     human hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words:


       Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer,
       Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;
       Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o'ercast,
       And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.

       Oh! what was love made for, if 'tis not the same
       Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?
       I know not, I ask not, if guilt's in that heart,
       I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.

       Thou hast call'd me thy Angel in moments of bliss,
       And thy Angel I'll be,'mid the horrors of this,--
       Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,
       And shield thee, and save thee,--or perish there too!


     It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while
     granting him Fancy--a distinction originating with Coleridge--than whom
     no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact is,
     that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other
     faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very
     naturally, the idea that he is fanciful _only._ But never was there a
     greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet.
     In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more
     profoundly--more weirdly _imaginative,_ in the best sense, than the
     lines commencing--"I would I were by that dim lake"--which are the
     composition of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to remember them.

     One of the noblest--and, speaking of Fancy--one of the most singularly
     fanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His "Fair Ines" had always
     for me an inexpressible charm:


       O saw ye not fair Ines?
         She's gone into the West,
       To dazzle when the sun is down
         And rob the world of rest
       She took our daylight with her,
         The smiles that we love best,
       With morning blushes on her cheek,
         And pearls upon her breast.

       O turn again, fair Ines,
         Before the fall of night,
       For fear the moon should shine alone,
         And stars unrivall'd bright;
       And blessed will the lover be
         That walks beneath their light,
       And breathes the love against thy cheek
         I dare not even write!

       Would I had been, fair Ines,
         That gallant cavalier,
       Who rode so gaily by thy side,
         And whisper'd thee so near!
       Were there no bonny dames at home,
         Or no true lovers here,
       That he should cross the seas to win
         The dearest of the dear?

       I saw thee, lovely Ines,
         Descend along the shore,
       With bands of noble gentlemen,
         And banners-waved before;
       And gentle youth and maidens gay,
         And snowy plumes they wore;
       It would have been a beauteous dream,
         If it had been no more!

       Alas, alas, fair Ines,
         She went away with song,
       With Music waiting on her steps,
         And shoutings of the throng;
       But some were sad and felt no mirth,
         But only Music's wrong,
       In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,
         To her you've loved so long.

       Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,
         That vessel never bore
       So fair a lady on its deck,
         Nor danced so light before,--
       Alas for pleasure on the sea,
         And sorrow on the shore!
       The smile that blest one lover's heart
         Has broken many more!


     "The Haunted House," by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever
     written,--one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of the
     most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It is,
     moreover, powerfully ideal--imaginative. I regret that its length
     renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of it
     permit me to offer the universally appreciated "Bridge of Sighs:"


       One more Unfortunate,
       Weary of breath,
       Rashly importunate
       Gone to her death!

       Take her up tenderly,
       Lift her with care;--
       Fashion'd so slenderly,
       Young and so fair!

       Look at her garments
       Clinging like cerements;
       Whilst the wave constantly
       Drips from her clothing;
       Take her up instantly,
       Loving, not loathing.

       Touch her not scornfully
       Think of her mournfully,
       Gently and humanly;
       Not of the stains of her,
       All that remains of her
       Now is pure womanly.

       Make no deep scrutiny
       Into her mutiny
       Rash and undutiful;
       Past all dishonor,
       Death has left on her
       Only the beautiful.

       Where the lamps quiver
       So far in the river,
       With many a light
       From window and casement,
       From garret to basement,
       She stood, with amazement,
       Houseless by night.

       The bleak wind of March
       Made her tremble and shiver;
       But not the dark arch,
       Or the black flowing river:
       Mad from life's history,
       Glad to death's mystery,
       Swift to be hurl'd--
       Anywhere, anywhere
       Out of the world!

       In she plunged boldly,
       No matter how coldly
       The rough river ran,--
       Over the brink of it,
       Picture it,--think of it,
       Dissolute Man!
       Lave in it, drink of it
       Then, if you can!

       Still, for all slips of hers,
       One of Eve's family--
       Wipe those poor lips of hers
       Oozing so clammily,
       Loop up her tresses
       Escaped from the comb,
       Her fair auburn tresses;
       Whilst wonderment guesses
       Where was her home?

       Who was her father?
       Who was her mother!
       Had she a sister?
       Had she a brother?
       Or was there a dearer one
       Still, and a nearer one
       Yet, than all other?

       Alas! for the rarity
       Of Christian charity
       Under the sun!
       Oh! it was pitiful!
       Near a whole city full,
       Home she had none.

       Sisterly, brotherly,
       Fatherly, motherly,
       Feelings had changed:
       Love, by harsh evidence,
       Thrown from its eminence;
       Even God's providence
       Seeming estranged.

       Take her up tenderly;
       Lift her with care;
       Fashion'd so slenderly,
       Young, and so fair!
       Ere her limbs frigidly
       Stiffen too rigidly,
       Decently,--kindly,--
       Smooth and compose them;
       And her eyes, close them,
       Staring so blindly!

       Dreadfully staring
       Through muddy impurity,
       As when with the daring
       Last look of despairing
       Fixed on futurity.

       Perishing gloomily,
       Spurred by contumely,
       Cold inhumanity,
       Burning insanity,
       Into her rest,--
       Cross her hands humbly,
       As if praying dumbly,
       Over her breast!
       Owning her weakness,
       Her evil behavior,
       And leaving, with meekness,
       Her sins to her Saviour!


     The vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The
     versification, although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the
     fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which
     is the thesis of the poem.

     Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from
     the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:


       Though the day of my destiny's over,
         And the star of my fate hath declined,
       Thy soft heart refused to discover
         The faults which so many could find;
       Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,
         It shrunk not to share it with me,
       And the love which my spirit hath painted
         It never hath found but in _thee._

       Then when nature around me is smiling,
         The last smile which answers to mine,
       I do not believe it beguiling,
         Because it reminds me of thine;
       And when winds are at war with the ocean,
         As the breasts I believed in with me,
       If their billows excite an emotion,
         It is that they bear me from _thee._

       Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,
         And its fragments are sunk in the wave,
       Though I feel that my soul is delivered
         To pain--it shall not be its slave.
       There is many a pang to pursue me:
         They may crush, but they shall not contemn--
       They may torture, but shall not subdue me--
         'Tis of _thee_ that I think--not of them.

       Though human, thou didst not deceive me,
         Though woman, thou didst not forsake,
       Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,
         Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,--
       Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,
         Though parted, it was not to fly,
       Though watchful, 'twas not to defame me,
         Nor mute, that the world might belie.

       Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,
         Nor the war of the many with one--
       If my soul was not fitted to prize it,
         'Twas folly not sooner to shun:
       And if dearly that error hath cost me,
         And more than I once could foresee,
       I have found that whatever it lost me,
         It could not deprive me of _thee_.

       From the wreck of the past, which hath perished,
         Thus much I at least may recall,
       It hath taught me that which I most cherished
         Deserved to be dearest of all:
       In the desert a fountain is springing,
         In the wide waste there still is a tree,
       And a bird in the solitude singing,
         Which speaks to my spirit of _thee_.


     Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification
     could scarcely be improved. No nobler theme ever engaged the pen of
     poet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself
     entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the
     unwavering love of woman.

     From Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the
     noblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a
     very brief specimen. I call him, and _think_ him the noblest of poets,
     _not_ because the impressions he produces are at _all_ times the most
     profound--_not_ because the poetical excitement which he induces is at
     _all_ times the most intense--but because it is at all times the most
     ethereal--in other words, the most elevating and most pure. No poet is
     so little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read is from his last
     long poem, "The Princess:"


         Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,
       Tears from the depth of some divine despair
       Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
       In looking on the happy Autumn fields,
       And thinking of the days that are no more.

         Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
       That brings our friends up from the underworld,
       Sad as the last which reddens over one
       That sinks with all we love below the verge;
       So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.

         Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
       The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds
       To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
       The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
       So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.

         Dear as remember'd kisses after death,
       And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd
       On lips that are for others; deep as love,
       Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
       O Death in Life, the days that are no more.


     Thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored
     to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my
     purpose to suggest that, while this Principle itself is strictly and
     simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of
     the Principle is always found in _an elevating excitement of the soul_,
     quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the
     Heart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in
     regard to passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to
     elevate the Soul. Love, on the contrary--Love--the true, the divine
     Eros--the Uranian as distinguished from the Dionasan Venus--is
     unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in
     regard to Truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we
     are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we
     experience at once the true poetical effect; but this effect is
     referable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth
     which merely served to render the harmony manifest.

     We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what
     true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which
     induce in the Poet himself the true poetical effect. He recognizes the
     ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in
     Heaven, in the volutes of the flower, in the clustering of low
     shrubberies, in the waving of the grain-fields, in the slanting of tall
     eastern trees, in the blue distance of mountains, in the grouping of
     clouds, in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks, in the gleaming of
     silver rivers, in the repose of sequestered lakes, in the star-mirroring
     depths of lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds, in the
     harp of Æolus, in the sighing of the night-wind, in the repining voice
     of the forest, in the surf that complains to the shore, in the fresh
     breath of the woods, in the scent of the violet, in the voluptuous
     perfume of the hyacinth, in the suggestive odor that comes to him at
     eventide from far-distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans,
     illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts, in all
     unworldly motives, in all holy impulses, in all chivalrous, generous,
     and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman, in the
     grace of her step, in the lustre of her eye, in the melody of her voice,
     in her soft laughter, in her sigh, in the harmony of the rustling of her
     robes. He deeply feels it in her winning endearments, in her burning
     enthusiasms, in her gentle charities, in her meek and devotional
     endurance, but above all, ah, far above all, he kneels to it, he
     worships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the
     altogether divine majesty of her _love._

     Let me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem, one very
     different in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by
     Motherwell, and is called "The Song of the Cavalier." With our modern
     and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare,
     we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize
     with the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the
     poem. To do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul
     of the old cavalier:


       A steed! a steed! of matchless speede!
         A sword of metal keene!
       Al else to noble heartes is drosse--
         Al else on earth is meane.
       The neighynge of the war-horse prowde.
         The rowleing of the drum,
       The clangor of the trumpet lowde--
         Be soundes from heaven that come.
       And oh! the thundering presse of knightes,
         When as their war-cryes welle,
       May tole from heaven an angel bright,
         And rowse a fiend from hell,

       Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,
         And don your helmes amaine,
       Deathe's couriers, Fame and Honor, call
         Us to the field againe.
       No shrewish teares shall fill your eye
         When the sword-hilt's in our hand,--
       Heart-whole we'll part, and no whit sighe
         For the fayrest of the land;
       Let piping swaine, and craven wight,
         Thus weepe and puling crye,
       Our business is like men to fight,
         And hero-like to die!

     THE PHILOSOPHY OF COMPOSITION.


     Charles Dickens, in a note now lying before me, alluding to an
     examination I once made of the mechanism of _Barnaby Rudge_, says--"By
     the way, are you aware that Godwin wrote his _Caleb Williams_ backwards?
     He first involved his hero in a web of difficulties, forming the second
     volume, and then, for the first, cast about him for some mode of
     accounting for what had been done."

     I cannot think this the _precise_ mode of procedure on the part of
     Godwin--and indeed what he himself acknowledges is not altogether in
     accordance with Mr. Dickens's idea--but the author of _Caleb Williams_
     was too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at
     least a somewhat similar process. Nothing is more clear than that every
     plot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its _dénouement_ before
     anything be attempted with the pen. It is only with the _dénouement_
     constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of
     consequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the
     tone at all points, tend to the development of the intention.

     There is a radical error, I think, in the usual mode of constructing a
     story. Either history affords a thesis--or one is suggested by an
     incident of the day--or, at best, the author sets himself to work in the
     combination of striking events to form merely the basis of his
     narrative---designing, generally, to fill in with description, dialogue,
     or autorial comment, whatever crevices of fact or action may, from page
     to page, render themselves apparent.

     I prefer commencing with the consideration of an _effect._ Keeping
     originality _always_ in view--for he is false to himself who ventures to
     dispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of
     interest--I say to myself, in the first place, "Of the innumerable
     effects or impressions of which the heart, the intellect, or (more
     generally) the soul is susceptible, what one shall I, on the present
     occasion, select?" Having chosen a novel first, and secondly, a vivid
     effect, I consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or
     tone--whether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone, or the converse,
     or by peculiarity both of incident and tone--afterwards looking about me
     (or rather within) for such combinations of events or tone as shall best
     aid me in the construction of the effect.

     I have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written
     by any author who would--that is to say, who could--detail, step by
     step, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its
     ultimate point of completion. Why such a paper has never been given to
     the world, I am much at a loss to say--but perhaps the autorial vanity
     has had more to do with the omission than any one other cause. Most
     writers--poets in especial--prefer having it understood that they
     compose by a species of fine frenzy--an ecstatic intuition--and would
     positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes,
     at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought--at the true
     purposes seized only at the last moment--at the innumerable glimpses of
     idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view--at the fully-matured
     fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable--at the cautious selections
     and rejections--at the painful erasures and interpolations,--in a word,
     at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for scene-shifting, the
     step-ladders and demon-traps, the cock's feathers, the red paint, and
     the black patches, which, in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred,
     constitute the properties of the literary _histrio._

     I am aware, on the other hand, that the case is by no means common, in
     which an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his
     conclusions have been attained. In general, suggestions, having arisen
     pell-mell, are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner.

     For my own part, I have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to,
     nor, at any time, the least difficulty in recalling to mind the
     progressive steps of any of my compositions; and, since the interest of
     an analysis, or reconstruction, such as I have considered a
     _desideratum_, is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in
     the thing analyzed, it will not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my
     part to show the _modus operandi_ by which some one of my own works was
     put together. I select "The Raven" as most generally known. It is my
     design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is
     referrible either to accident or intuition--that the work proceeded,
     step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence
     of a mathematical problem.

     Let us dismiss, as irrelevant to the poem, _per se_, the
     circumstance--or say the necessity--which, in the first place, gave rise
     to the intention of composing _a_ poem that should suit at once the
     popular and the critical taste.

     We commence, then, with this intention.

     The initial consideration was that of extent. If any literary work is
     too long to be read at one sitting, we must be content to dispense with
     the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression--for,
     if two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, and
     everything like totality is at once destroyed. But since, _ceteris
     paribus_, no poet can afford to dispense with _anything_ that may
     advance his design, it but remains to be seen whether there is, in
     extent, any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends
     it. Here I say no, at once. What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely
     a succession of brief ones--that is to say, of brief poetical effects.
     It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it
     intensely excites, by elevating the soul; and all intense excitements
     are, through a psychal necessity, brief. For this reason, at least
     one-half of the "Paradise Lost" is essentially prose--a succession of
     poetical excitements interspersed, _inevitably_, with corresponding
     depressions--the whole being deprived, through the extremeness of its
     length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity of
     effect.

     It appears evident, then, that there is a distinct limit, as regards
     length, to all works of literary art--the limit of a single sitting--and
     that, although in certain classes of prose composition, such as
     _Robinson Crusoe_ (demanding no unity), this limit may be advantageously
     overpassed, it can never properly be overpassed in a poem. Within this
     limit, the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to
     its merit--in other words, to the excitement or elevation--again, in
     other words, to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is
     capable of inducing; for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct
     ratio of the intensity of the intended effect--this, with one
     proviso--that a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for
     the production of any effect at all.

     Holding in view these considerations, as well as that degree of
     excitement which I deemed not above the popular, while not below the
     critical taste, I reached at once what I conceived the proper _length_
     for my intended poem--a length of about one hundred lines. It is, in
     fact, a hundred and eight.

     My next thought concerned the choice of an impression, or effect, to be
     conveyed: and here I may as well observe that, throughout the
     construction, I kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work
     _universally_ appreciable. I should be carried too far out of my
     immediate topic were I to demonstrate a point upon which I have
     repeatedly insisted, and which, with the poetical, stands not in the
     slightest need of demonstration--the point, I mean, that Beauty is the
     sole legitimate province of the poem. A few words, however, in
     elucidation of my real meaning, which some of my friends have evinced a
     disposition to misrepresent. That pleasure which is at once the most
     intense, the most elevating, and the most pure, is, I believe, found in
     the contemplation of the beautiful. When, indeed, men speak of Beauty,
     they mean, precisely, not a quality, as is supposed, but an effect--they
     refer, in short, just to that intense and pure elevation of _soul_
     --_not_ of intellect, or of heart--upon which I have commented, and
     which is experienced in consequence of contemplating "the beautiful."
     Now I designate Beauty as the province of the poem, merely because it is
     an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring from direct
     causes--that objects should be attained through means best adapted for
     their attainment--no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the
     peculiar elevation alluded to is _most readily_ attained in the poem.
     Now the object Truth, or the satisfaction of the intellect, and the
     object Passion, or the excitement of the heart, are, although attainable
     to a certain extent in poetry, far more readily attainable in prose.
     Truth, in fact, demands a precision, and Passion a _homeliness_ (the
     truly passionate will comprehend me) which are absolutely antagonistic
     to that Beauty which, I maintain, is the excitement, or pleasurable
     elevation, of the soul. It by no means follows from anything here said
     that passion, or even truth, may not be introduced, and even profitably
     introduced, into a poem--for they may serve in elucidation, or aid the
     general effect, as do discords in music, by contrast--but the true
     artist will always contrive, first, to tone them into proper
     subservience to the predominant aim, and secondly, to enveil them, as
     far as possible, in that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence
     of the poem.

     Regarding, then, Beauty as my province, my next question referred to the
     _tone_ of its highest manifestation--and all experience has shown that
     this tone is one of _sadness_. Beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme
     development, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears. Melancholy
     is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones.

     The length, the province, and the tone being thus determined, I betook
     myself to ordinary induction, with the view of obtaining some artistic
     piquancy which might serve me as a key-note in the construction of the
     poem--some pivot upon which the whole structure might turn. In carefully
     thinking over all the usual artistic effects--or more properly _points_,
     in the theatrical sense--I did not fail to perceive immediately that no
     one had been so universally employed as that of the _refrain_. The
     universality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic
     value, and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis. I
     considered it, however, with regard to its susceptibility of
     improvement, and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition. As commonly
     used, the _refrain_, or burden, not only is limited to lyric verse, but
     depends for its impression upon the force of monotone--both in sound and
     thought. The pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identity--of
     repetition. I resolved to diversify, and so heighten the effect, by
     adhering in general to the monotone of sound, while I continually varied
     that of thought: that is to say, I determined to produce continuously
     novel effects, by the variation _of the application_ of the
     _refrain_--the _refrain_ itself remaining, for the most part, unvaried.

     These points being settled, I next bethought me of the _nature_ of my
     _refrain_. Since its application was to be repeatedly varied, it was
     clear that the _refrain_ itself must be brief, for there would have been
     an insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in
     any sentence of length. In proportion to the brevity of the sentence
     would of course be the facility of the variation. This led me at once to
     a single word as the best _refrain_.

     The question now arose as to the _character_ of the word. Having made up
     my mind to a _refrain_, the division of the poem into stanzas was of
     course a corollary, the _refrain_ forming the close to each stanza. That
     such a close, to have force, must be sonorous and susceptible of
     protracted emphasis, admitted no doubt, and these considerations
     inevitably led me to the long _o_ as the most sonorous vowel in
     connection with _r_ as the most producible consonant.

     The sound of the _refrain_ being thus determined, it became necessary to
     select a word embodying this sound, and at the same time in the fullest
     possible keeping with that melancholy which I had predetermined as the
     tone of the poem. In such a search it would have been absolutely
     impossible to overlook the word "Nevermore." In fact, it was the very
     first which presented itself.

     The next _desideratum_ was a pretext for the continuous use of the one
     word "nevermore." In observing the difficulty which I at once found in
     inventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition,
     I did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the
     pre-assumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously
     spoken by a _human_ being--I did not fail to perceive, in short, that
     the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the
     exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word. Here,
     then, immediately arose the idea of a _non_-reasoning creature capable
     of speech; and very naturally, a parrot, in the first instance,
     suggested itself, but was superseded forthwith by a Raven as equally
     capable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the intended
     _tone_.

     I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of
     ill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word "Nevermore" at the
     conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length
     about one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object
     _supremeness_ or perfection at all points, I asked myself--"Of all
     melancholy topics what, according to the _universal_ understanding of
     mankind, is the _most_ melancholy?" Death, was the obvious reply. "And
     when," I said, "is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?" From
     what I have already explained at some length, the answer here also is
     obvious--"When it most closely allies itself to _Beauty_; the death,
     then, of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in
     the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for
     such topic are those of a bereaved lover."

     I had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased
     mistress and a Raven continuously repeating the word "Nevermore." I had
     to combine these, bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the
     _application_ of the word repeated, but the only intelligible mode of
     such combination is that of imagining the Raven employing the word in
     answer to the queries of the lover. And here it was that I saw at once
     the opportunity afforded for the effect on which I had been depending,
     that is to say, the effect of the _variation of application_. I saw that
     I could make the first query propounded by the lover--the first query to
     which the Raven should reply "Nevermore"--that I could make this first
     query a commonplace one, the second less so, the third still less, and
     so on, until at length the lover, startled from his original
     _nonchalance_ by the melancholy character of the word itself, by its
     frequent repetition, and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of
     the fowl that uttered it, is at length excited to superstition, and
     wildly propounds queries of a far different character--queries whose
     solution he has passionately at heart--propounds them half in
     superstition and half in that species of despair which delights in
     self-torture--propounds them not altogether because he believes in the
     prophetic or demoniac character of the bird (which reason assures him is
     merely repeating a lesson learned by rote), but because he experiences a
     frenzied pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the
     _expected_ "Nevermore" the most delicious because the most intolerable
     of sorrow. Perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me, or, more
     strictly, thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction, I
     first established in mind the climax or concluding query--that query to
     which "Nevermore" should be in the last place an answer--that query in
     reply to which this word "Nevermore" should involve the utmost
     conceivable amount of sorrow and despair.

     Here then the poem may be said to have its beginning, at the end where
     all works of art should begin; for it was here at this point of my
     preconsiderations that I first put pen to paper in the composition of
     the stanza:


       "Prophet," said I, "thing of evil! prophet still if bird or devil!
       By that heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore,
       Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant Aidenn,
       It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
       Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."
           Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."


     I composed this stanza, at this point, first that, by establishing the
     climax, I might the better vary and graduate, as regards seriousness,
     and importance the preceding queries of the lover, and secondly, that I
     might definitely settle the rhythm, the metre, and the length and
     general arrangement of the stanza, as well as graduate the stanzas which
     were to precede, so that none of them might surpass this in rhythmical
     effect. Had I been able in the subsequent composition to construct more
     vigorous stanzas, I should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them
     so as not to interfere with the climacteric effect.

     And here I may as well say a few words of the versification. My first
     object (as usual) was originality. The extent to which this has been
     neglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in
     the world. Admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere
     _rhythm_, it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and
     stanza are absolutely infinite; and yet, for _centuries, no man, in
     verse has ever done, or ever seemed to think of doing, an original
     thing_. The fact is that originality (unless in minds of very unusual
     force) is by no means a matter, as some suppose, of impulse or
     intuition. In general, to be found, it must be elaborately sought and,
     although a positive merit of the highest class, demands in its
     attainment less of invention than negation.

     Of course I pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of
     the "Raven." The former is trochaic--the latter is octametre
     acatalectic, alternating with heptametre catalectic repeated in the
     _refrain_ of the fifth verse, and terminating with tetrametre
     catalectic. Less pedantically, the feet employed throughout (trochees)
     consists of a long syllable followed by a short; the first line of the
     stanza consists of eight of these feet, the second of seven and a half
     (in effect two-thirds), the third of eight, the fourth of seven and a
     half, the fifth the same, the sixth three and a half. Now, each of these
     lines taken individually has been employed before, and what originality
     the "Raven" has, is in their _combinations into stanzas;_ nothing even
     remotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted. The
     effect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and
     some altogether novel effects, arising from an extension of the
     application of the principles of rhyme and alliteration.

     The next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the
     lover and the Raven--and the first branch of this consideration was the
     _locale_. For this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a
     forest, or the fields--but it has always appeared to me that a close
     _circumscription of space_ is absolutely necessary to the effect of
     insulated incident--it has the force of a frame to a picture. It has an
     indisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention, and, of
     course, must not be confounded with mere unity of place.

     I determined, then, to place the lover in his chamber--in a chamber
     rendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it. The
     room is represented as richly furnished--this in mere pursuance of the
     ideas I have already explained on the subject of Beauty, as the sole
     true poetical thesis.

     The _locale_ being thus determined, I had now to introduce the bird--and
     the thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable. The
     idea of making the lover suppose, in the first instance, that the
     flapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter, is a "tapping" at
     the door, originated in a wish to increase, by prolonging, the reader's
     curiosity, and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from
     the lover's throwing open the door, finding all dark, and thence
     adopting the half-fancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that
     knocked.

     I made the night tempestuous, first to account for the Raven's seeking
     admission, and secondly, for the effect of contrast with the (physical)
     serenity within the chamber.

     I made the bird alight on the bust of Pallas, also for the effect of
     contrast between the marble and the plumage--it being understood that
     the bust was absolutely _suggested_ by the bird--the bust of _Pallas_
     being chosen, first, as most in keeping with the scholarship of the
     lover, and, secondly, for the sonorousness of the word, Pallas, itself.

     About the middle of the poem, also, I have availed myself of the force
     of contrast, with a view of deepening the ultimate impression. For
     example, an air of the fantastic--approaching as nearly to the ludicrous
     as was admissible--is given to the Raven's entrance. He comes in "with
     many a flirt and flutter."


       Not the _least obeisance made he_--not a moment stopped or stayed he,
       _But with mien of lord or lady_, perched above my chamber door.


     In the two stanzas which follow, the design is more obviously carried
     out:


       Then this ebony bird beguiling my _sad fancy_ into smiling
       By the _grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore_,
       "Though thy _crest be shorn and shaven_, thou," I said, "art sure no
         craven,
       Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the nightly shore--
       Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shore?"
           Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

       Much I marvelled _this ungainly fowl_ to hear discourse so plainly,
       Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
       For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
       _Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--
       Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door_,
           With such name as "Nevermore."


     The effect of the dénouement being thus provided for, I immediately drop
     the fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousness--this tone
     commencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted, with
     the line,


       But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only, etc.


     From this epoch the lover no longer jests--no longer sees anything even
     of the fantastic in the Raven's demeanor. He speaks of him as a "grim,
     ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore," and feels the
     "fiery eyes" burning into his "bosom's core." This revolution of
     thought, or fancy, on the lover's part, is intended to induce a similar
     one on the part of the reader--to bring the mind into a proper frame for
     the _dénouement_--which is now brought about as rapidly and as
     _directly_ as possible.

     With the _dénouement_ proper--with the Raven's reply, "Nevermore," to
     the lover's final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another
     world--the poem, in its obvious phase, that of a simple narrative, may
     be said to have its completion. So far, everything is within the limits
     of the accountable--of the real. A raven having learned by rote the
     single word "Nevermore," and having escaped from the custody of its
     owner, is driven at midnight, through the violence of a storm, to seek
     admission at a window from which a light still gleams--the
     chamber-window of a student, occupied half in pouring over a volume,
     half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased. The casement being
     thrown open at the fluttering of the bird's wings, the bird itself
     perches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the
     student, who, amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitor's
     demeanor, demands of it, in jest and with out looking for a reply, its
     name. The Raven addressed, answers with its customary word,
     "Nevermore"--a word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart
     of the student, who, giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts
     suggested by the occasion, is again startled by the fowl's repetition of
     "Nevermore." The student now guesses the state of the case, but is
     impelled, as I have before explained, by the human thirst for
     self-torture, and in part by superstition, to propound such queries to
     the bird as will bring him, the lover, the most of the luxury of sorrow
     through the anticipated answer "Nevermore." With the indulgence, to the
     extreme, of this self-torture, the narration, in what I have termed its
     first or obvious phase, has a natural termination, and so far there has
     been no overstepping of the limits of the real.

     But in subjects so handled, however skilfully, or with however vivid an
     array of incident, there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which
     repels the artistical eye. Two things are invariably required--first,
     some amount of complexity, or more properly, adaptation; and, secondly,
     some amount of suggestiveness, some undercurrent, however indefinite of
     meaning. It is this latter, in especial, which imparts to a work of art
     so much of that _richness_ (to borrow from colloquy a forcible term)
     which we are too fond of confounding with _the ideal_. It is the
     _excess_ of the suggested meaning--it is the rendering this the upper
     instead of the under current of theme--which turns into prose (and that
     of the very flattest kind) the so-called poetry of the so-called
     transcendentalists.

     Holding these opinions, I added the two concluding stanzas of the
     poem--their suggestiveness being thus made to pervade all the narrative
     which has preceded them. The undercurrent of meaning is rendered first
     apparent in the lines:


       "Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
                    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore!"


     It will be observed that the words, "from out my heart," involve the
     first metaphorical expression in the poem. They, with the answer,
     "Nevermore," dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been
     previously narrated. The reader begins now to regard the Raven as
     emblematical--but it is not until the very last line of the very last
     stanza, that the intention of making him emblematical of _Mournful and
     never-ending Remembrance_ is permitted distinctly to be seen:


       And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
       On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
       And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
       And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
       And my soul _from out that shadow_ that lies floating on the floor
                   Shall be lifted--nevermore!





              *       *       *       *       *





     OLD ENGLISH POETRY. [1]


     It should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with
     which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be attributed to
     what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry--we mean to the simple
     love of the antique--and that, again, a third of even the proper _poetic
     sentiment_ inspired by their writings, should be ascribed to a fact
     which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and
     with the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a
     merit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout
     admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,
     would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,
     wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on
     being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he
     would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general
     handling. This quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to
     ideality, but in the case in question it arises independently of the
     author's will, and is altogether apart from his intention. Words and
     their rhythm have varied. Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid
     delight, and which delight, in many instances, may be traced to the one
     source, quaintness, must have worn in the days of their construction a
     very commonplace air. This is, of course, no argument against the poems
     _now_--we mean it only as against the poets _then_. There is a growing
     desire to overrate them. The old English muse was frank, guileless,
     sincere and although very learned, still learned without art. No general
     error evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of
     supposing Donne and Cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth
     and Coleridge are so. With the two former ethics were the end--with the
     two latter the means. The poet of the "Creation" wished, by highly
     artificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truth--the
     poet of the "Ancient Mariner" to infuse the Poetic Sentiment through
     channels suggested by analysis. The one finished by complete failure
     what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the other, by a path
     which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a triumph which is
     not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the
     multitude. But in this view even the "metaphysical verse" of Cowley is
     but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the man. And he
     was in this but a type of his _school_--for we may as well designate in
     this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the
     volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very
     perceptible general character. They used little art in composition.
     Their writings sprang immediately from the soul--and partook intensely
     of that soul's nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of
     this _abandon_--to elevate immeasurably all the energies of mind--but,
     again, so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all
     good things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility,
     as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind
     in such a school will be found inferior to those results in one
     (_ceteris paribus_) more artificial.

     We cannot bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the "Book of
     Gems" are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible
     idea of the beauty of the _school_--but if the intention had been merely
     to show the school's character, the attempt might have been considered
     successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us
     of the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of
     their antiquity. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly please
     us. His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. His
     opinion, for example, of Sir Henry's Wotton's "Verses on the Queen of
     Bohemia"--that "there are few finer things in our language," is
     untenable and absurd.

     In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of
     Poesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time.
     Here everything is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No
     prepossession for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no
     other prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of
     poetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments,
     stitched, apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and
     without even an attempt at adaptation.

     In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with "The
     Shepherd's Hunting" by Withers--a poem partaking, in a remarkable
     degree, of the peculiarities of 'Il Penseroso'. Speaking of Poesy, the
     author says:


       "By the murmur of a spring,
       Or the least boughs rustleling,
       By a daisy whose leaves spread,
       Shut when Titan goes to bed,
       Or a shady bush or tree,
       She could more infuse in me
       Than all Nature's beauties con
       In some other wiser man.
       By her help I also now
       Make this churlish place allow
       Something that may sweeten gladness
       In the very gall of sadness--
       The dull loneness, the black shade,
       That these hanging vaults have made
       The strange music of the waves
       Beating on these hollow caves,
       This black den which rocks emboss,
       Overgrown with eldest moss,
       The rude portals that give light
       More to terror than delight,
       This my chamber of neglect
       Walled about with disrespect;
       From all these and this dull air
       A fit object for despair,
       She hath taught me by her might
       To draw comfort and delight."


     But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general
     character of the English antique. Something more of this will be found
     in Corbet's "Farewell to the Fairies!" We copy a portion of Marvell's
     "Maiden lamenting for her Fawn," which we prefer--not only as a specimen
     of the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in
     pathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness--to anything
     of its species:


       "It is a wondrous thing how fleet
       'Twas on those little silver feet,
       With what a pretty skipping grace
       It oft would challenge me the race,
       And when't had left me far away
       'Twould stay, and run again, and stay;
       For it was nimbler much than hinds,
       And trod as if on the four winds.
       I have a garden of my own,
       But so with roses overgrown,
       And lilies, that you would it guess
       To be a little wilderness;
       And all the spring-time of the year
       It only loved to be there.
       Among the beds of lilies I
       Have sought it oft where it should lie,
       Yet could not, till itself would rise,
       Find it, although before mine eyes.
       For in the flaxen lilies shade
       It like a bank of lilies laid;
       Upon the roses it would feed
       Until its lips even seemed to bleed,
       And then to me 'twould boldly trip,
       And print those roses on my lip,
       But all its chief delight was still
       With roses thus itself to fill,
       And its pure virgin limbs to fold
       In whitest sheets of lilies cold,
       Had it lived long, it would have been
       Lilies without, roses within."


     How truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It
     pervades all. It comes over the sweet melody of the words--over the
     gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself--even
     over the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the
     beauties and good qualities of her favorite--like the cool shadow of a
     summer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets, "and all sweet flowers."
     The whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is
     an idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the
     artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief,
     or the fragrance and warmth and _appropriateness_ of the little
     nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon
     them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy
     little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on
     her face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in
     the few lines we have quoted--the _wonder_ of the little maiden at the
     fleetness of her favorite--the "little silver feet"--the fawn
     challenging his mistress to a race with "a pretty skipping grace,"
     running on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her
     approach only to fly from it again--can we not distinctly perceive all
     these things? How exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,


       "And trod as if on the four winds!"


     a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the
     speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then
     consider the garden of "my own," so overgrown, entangled with roses and
     lilies, as to be "a little wilderness"--the fawn loving to be there, and
     there "only"--the maiden seeking it "where it _should_ lie"--and not
     being able to distinguish it from the flowers until "itself would
     rise"--the lying among the lilies "like a bank of lilies"--the loving to
     "fill itself with roses,"


       "And its pure virgin limbs to fold
       In whitest sheets of lilies cold,"


     and these things being its "chief" delights--and then the pre-eminent
     beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole
     only renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence,
     the artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more
     passionate admiration of the bereaved child:


       "Had it lived long, it would have been
       Lilies without, roses within."

       THE PURLOINED LETTER

            Nil sapientiae odiosius acumine nimio.

                                       _Seneca_.

       At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18-, I was
       enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company
       with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or
       book-closet, au troisiême, No. 33, Rue Dunôt, Faubourg St. Germain. For
       one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to
       any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied
       with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the
       chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics
       which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period
       of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery
       attending the murder of Marie Rogêt. I looked upon it, therefore, as
       something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown
       open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G--, the Prefect of the
       Parisian police.

       We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the
       entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen
       him for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now
       arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without
       doing so, upon G.’s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather
       to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had
       occasioned a great deal of trouble.

       “If it is any point requiring reflection,” observed Dupin, as he
       forebore to enkindle the wick, “we shall examine it to better purpose in
       the dark.”

       “That is another of your odd notions,” said the Prefect, who had a
       fashion of calling every thing “odd” that was beyond his comprehension,
       and thus lived amid an absolute legion of “oddities.”

       “Very true,” said Dupin, as he supplied his visiter with a pipe, and
       rolled towards him a comfortable chair.

       “And what is the difficulty now?” I asked. “Nothing more in the
       assassination way, I hope?”

       “Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very simple
       indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well
       ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of
       it, because it is so excessively odd.”

       “Simple and odd,” said Dupin.

       “Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all been
       a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us
       altogether.”

       “Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at
       fault,” said my friend.

       “What nonsense you do talk!” replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.

       “Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,” said Dupin.

       “Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?”

       “A little too self-evident.”

       “Ha! ha! ha--ha! ha! ha!--ho! ho! ho!” roared our visiter, profoundly
       amused, “oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!”

       “And what, after all, is the matter on hand?” I asked.

       “Why, I will tell you,” replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady
       and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. “I will tell
       you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this
       is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most
       probably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it
       to any one.”

       “Proceed,” said I.

       “Or not,” said Dupin.

       “Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high
       quarter, that a certain document of the last importance, has been
       purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is
       known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also,
       that it still remains in his possession.”

       “How is this known?” asked Dupin.

       “It is clearly inferred,” replied the Prefect, “from the nature of the
       document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at
       once arise from its passing out of the robber’s possession; that is to
       say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.”

       “Be a little more explicit,” I said.

       “Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder
       a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely
       valuable.” The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.

       “Still I do not quite understand,” said Dupin.

       “No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall
       be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most
       exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an
       ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so
       jeopardized.”

       “But this ascendancy,” I interposed, “would depend upon the robber’s
       knowledge of the loser’s knowledge of the robber. Who would dare--”

       “The thief,” said G., “is the Minister D--, who dares all things, those
       unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft was
       not less ingenious than bold. The document in question--a letter, to
       be frank--had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the
       royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the
       entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her
       wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in
       a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The
       address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the
       letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D--. His
       lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting
       of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and
       fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in
       his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one
       in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in
       close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen
       minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes
       also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful
       owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the
       presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister
       decamped; leaving his own letter--one of no importance--upon the table.”

       “Here, then,” said Dupin to me, “you have precisely what you demand
       to make the ascendancy complete--the robber’s knowledge of the loser’s
       knowledge of the robber.”

       “Yes,” replied the Prefect; “and the power thus attained has, for some
       months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous
       extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of
       the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be
       done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to
       me.”

       “Than whom,” said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, “no more
       sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.”

       “You flatter me,” replied the Prefect; “but it is possible that some
       such opinion may have been entertained.”

       “It is clear,” said I, “as you observe, that the letter is still in
       possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any
       employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment
       the power departs.”

       “True,” said G.; “and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care
       was to make thorough search of the minister’s hotel; and here my chief
       embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.
       Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result
       from giving him reason to suspect our design.”

       “But,” said I, “you are quite au fait in these investigations. The
       Parisian police have done this thing often before.”

       “O yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the
       minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from
       home all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a
       distance from their master’s apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans,
       are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can
       open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has
       not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged,
       personally, in ransacking the D-- Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to
       mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon
       the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more
       astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and
       corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be
       concealed.”

       “But is it not possible,” I suggested, “that although the letter may
       be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have
       concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?”

       “This is barely possible,” said Dupin. “The present peculiar condition
       of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D--
       is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the
       document--its susceptibility of being produced at a moment’s notice--a
       point of nearly equal importance with its possession.”

       “Its susceptibility of being produced?” said I.

       “That is to say, of being destroyed,” said Dupin.

       “True,” I observed; “the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for
       its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out
       of the question.”

       “Entirely,” said the Prefect. “He has been twice waylaid, as if by
       footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.”

       “You might have spared yourself this trouble,” said Dupin. “D--, I
       presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated
       these waylayings, as a matter of course.”

       “Not altogether a fool,” said G., “but then he’s a poet, which I take to
       be only one remove from a fool.”

       “True,” said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from
       his meerschaum, “although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.”

       “Suppose you detail,” said I, “the particulars of your search.”

       “Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched every where. I have
       had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room
       by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined,
       first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer;
       and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a
       thing as a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a
       ‘secret’ drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so
       plain. There is a certain amount of bulk--of space--to be accounted for
       in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a
       line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The
       cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ.
       From the tables we removed the tops.”

       “Why so?”

       “Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of
       furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then
       the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the
       top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same
       way.”

       “But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?” I asked.

       “By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding
       of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to
       proceed without noise.”

       “But you could not have removed--you could not have taken to pieces all
       articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a
       deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into
       a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large
       knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of
       a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?”

       “Certainly not; but we did better--we examined the rungs of every
       chair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every description of
       furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been
       any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it
       instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been
       as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the glueing--any unusual gaping
       in the joints--would have sufficed to insure detection.”

       “I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates,
       and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains and
       carpets.”

       “That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of
       the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided
       its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that
       none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch
       throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining,
       with the microscope, as before.”

       “The two houses adjoining!” I exclaimed; “you must have had a great deal
       of trouble.”

       “We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!”

       “You include the grounds about the houses?”

       “All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively
       little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it
       undisturbed.”

       “You looked among D--‘s papers, of course, and into the books of the
       library?”

       “Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened
       every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting
       ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our
       police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover,
       with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most
       jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been
       recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the
       fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just
       from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with
       the needles.”

       “You explored the floors beneath the carpets?”

       “Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the
       microscope.”

       “And the paper on the walls?”

       “Yes.”

       “You looked into the cellars?”

       “We did.”

       “Then,” I said, “you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter
       is not upon the premises, as you suppose.”

       “I fear you are right there,” said the Prefect. “And now, Dupin, what
       would you advise me to do?”

       “To make a thorough re-search of the premises.”

       “That is absolutely needless,” replied G--. “I am not more sure that I
       breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.”

       “I have no better advice to give you,” said Dupin. “You have, of course,
       an accurate description of the letter?”

       “Oh yes!”--And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book proceeded
       to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the
       external appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing
       the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely
       depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before. In
       about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupied
       very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some
       ordinary conversation. At length I said,--

       “Well, but G--, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at
       last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the
       Minister?”

       “Confound him, say I--yes; I made the re-examination, however, as Dupin
       suggested--but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.”

       “How much was the reward offered, did you say?” asked Dupin.

       “Why, a very great deal--a very liberal reward--I don’t like to say how
       much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn’t mind giving
       my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could
       obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming of more and more
       importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it were
       trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.”

       “Why, yes,” said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his
       meerschaum, “I really--think, G--, you have not exerted yourself--to the
       utmost in this matter. You might--do a little more, I think, eh?”

       “How?--in what way?’

       “Why--puff, puff--you might--puff, puff--employ counsel in the
       matter, eh?--puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell of
       Abernethy?”

       “No; hang Abernethy!”

       “To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain rich
       miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical
       opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a
       private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an
       imaginary individual.

       “‘We will suppose,’ said the miser, ‘that his symptoms are such and
       such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?’

       “‘Take!’ said Abernethy, ‘why, take advice, to be sure.’”

       “But,” said the Prefect, a little discomposed, “I am perfectly willing
       to take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give fifty thousand
       francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.”

       “In that case,” replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing
       a check-book, “you may as well fill me up a check for the amount
       mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.”

       I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken.
       For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking
       incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed
       starting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in some
       measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares,
       finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and
       handed it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully
       and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took
       thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary grasped it
       in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid
       glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the
       door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house,
       without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill
       up the check.

       When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.

       “The Parisian police,” he said, “are exceedingly able in their way.
       They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the
       knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G--
       detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D--,
       I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory
       investigation--so far as his labors extended.”

       “So far as his labors extended?” said I.

       “Yes,” said Dupin. “The measures adopted were not only the best of
       their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been
       deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond
       a question, have found it.”

       I merely laughed--but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.

       “The measures, then,” he continued, “were good in their kind, and well
       executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and
       to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the
       Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his
       designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for
       the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I
       knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game
       of ‘even and odd’ attracted universal admiration. This game is simple,
       and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of
       these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd.
       If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The
       boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he
       had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and
       admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant
       simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, ‘are
       they even or odd?’ Our schoolboy replies, ‘odd,’ and loses; but upon the
       second trial he wins, for he then says to himself, ‘the simpleton
       had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just
       sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore
       guess odd;’--he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree
       above the first, he would have reasoned thus: ‘This fellow finds that in
       the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to
       himself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd,
       as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that
       this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting
       it even as before. I will therefore guess even;’--he guesses even, and
       wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows
       termed ‘lucky,’--what, in its last analysis, is it?”

       “It is merely,” I said, “an identification of the reasoner’s intellect
       with that of his opponent.”

       “It is,” said Dupin; “and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he
       effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I
       received answer as follows: ‘When I wish to find out how wise, or how
       stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts
       at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as
       possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see
       what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or
       correspond with the expression.’ This response of the schoolboy lies at
       the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to
       Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.”

       “And the identification,” I said, “of the reasoner’s intellect with that
       of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracy
       with which the opponent’s intellect is admeasured.”

       “For its practical value it depends upon this,” replied Dupin; “and the
       Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this
       identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through
       non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They
       consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for
       anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have
       hidden it. They are right in this much--that their own ingenuity is a
       faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the
       individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils
       them, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and
       very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in
       their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency--by
       some extraordinary reward--they extend or exaggerate their old modes of
       practice, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this
       case of D--, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is
       all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the
       microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered
       square inches--what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of
       the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon
       the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect,
       in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he
       has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,--not
       exactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg--but, at least, in some
       out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought
       which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in
       a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that such recherchés nooks for
       concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be
       adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment,
       a disposal of the article concealed--a disposal of it in this recherché
       manner,--is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and
       thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether
       upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and
       where the case is of importance--or, what amounts to the same thing in
       the policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,--the qualities in
       question have never been known to fail. You will now understand what I
       meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden any where
       within the limits of the Prefect’s examination--in other words, had the
       principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of
       the Prefect--its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond
       question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified;
       and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the
       Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools
       are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non
       distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools.”

       “But is this really the poet?” I asked. “There are two brothers, I know;
       and both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister I believe has
       written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician,
       and no poet.”

       “You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and
       mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could
       not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the
       Prefect.”

       “You surprise me,” I said, “by these opinions, which have been
       contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at naught
       the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason has long
       been regarded as the reason par excellence.”

       “‘Il y a à parièr,’” replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, “‘que toute
       idée publique, toute convention reçue est une sottise, car elle a
       convenue au plus grand nombre.’ The mathematicians, I grant you, have
       done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and
       which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With an
       art worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term
       ‘analysis’ into application to algebra. The French are the originators
       of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance--if
       words derive any value from applicability--then ‘analysis’ conveys
       ‘algebra’ about as much as, in Latin, ‘ambitus’ implies ‘ambition,’
       ‘religio’ ‘religion,’ or ‘homines honesti,’ a set of honorablemen.”

       “You have a quarrel on hand, I see,” said I, “with some of the
       algebraists of Paris; but proceed.”

       “I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which
       is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical.
       I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The
       mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning
       is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great
       error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure
       algebra, are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious
       that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been
       received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is
       true of relation--of form and quantity--is often grossly false in regard
       to morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue
       that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the
       axiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives,
       each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal
       to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical
       truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the
       mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if
       they were of an absolutely general applicability--as the world indeed
       imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned ‘Mythology,’ mentions
       an analogous source of error, when he says that ‘although the Pagan
       fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make
       inferences from them as existing realities.’ With the algebraists,
       however, who are Pagans themselves, the ‘Pagan fables’ are believed, and
       the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as
       through an unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet
       encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal
       roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith
       that x2+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of
       these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe
       occasions may occur where x2+px is not altogether equal to q, and,
       having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as
       speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you
       down.

       “I mean to say,” continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his
       last observations, “that if the Minister had been no more than a
       mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving
       me this check. I know him, however, as both mathematician and poet,
       and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the
       circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too,
       and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be
       aware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could not have
       failed to anticipate--and events have proved that he did not fail to
       anticipate--the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have
       foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His
       frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect
       as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford
       opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to
       impress them with the conviction to which G--, in fact, did finally
       arrive--the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I
       felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains
       in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of
       policial action in searches for articles concealed--I felt that this
       whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the
       Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary
       nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to
       see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be
       as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the
       gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that
       he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not
       deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember,
       perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our
       first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so
       much on account of its being so very self-evident.”

       “Yes,” said I, “I remember his merriment well. I really thought he would
       have fallen into convulsions.”

       “The material world,” continued Dupin, “abounds with very strict
       analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been
       given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made
       to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description. The
       principle of the vis inertiæ, for example, seems to be identical in
       physics and metaphysics. It is not more true in the former, that a large
       body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that
       its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it
       is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more
       forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those
       of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed
       and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. Again:
       have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop-doors,
       are the most attractive of attention?”

       “I have never given the matter a thought,” I said.

       “There is a game of puzzles,” he resumed, “which is played upon a map.
       One party playing requires another to find a given word--the name of
       town, river, state or empire--any word, in short, upon the motley and
       perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to
       embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names;
       but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from
       one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered
       signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being
       excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely
       analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers
       to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too
       palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above
       or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought
       it probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter
       immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best
       preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.

       “But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating
       ingenuity of D--; upon the fact that the document must always have been
       at hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive
       evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within the
       limits of that dignitary’s ordinary search--the more satisfied I
       became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to the
       comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at
       all.

       “Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles,
       and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial
       hotel. I found D-- at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual,
       and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps,
       the most really energetic human being now alive--but that is only when
       nobody sees him.

       “To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the
       necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and
       thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent only
       upon the conversation of my host.

       “I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat,
       and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other
       papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here,
       however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to
       excite particular suspicion.

       “At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a
       trumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a
       dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of
       the mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments,
       were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last
       was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the
       middle--as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up
       as worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a
       large black seal, bearing the D-- cipher very conspicuously, and was
       addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D--, the minister, himself.
       It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into
       one of the uppermost divisions of the rack.

       “No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be
       that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance,
       radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so
       minute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D--
       cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S--
       family. Here, the address, to the Minister, diminutive and feminine;
       there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly
       bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But,
       then, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the
       dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with
       the true methodical habits of D--, and so suggestive of a design to
       delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document;
       these things, together with the hyper-obtrusive situation of this
       document, full in the view of every visiter, and thus exactly in
       accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these
       things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who came
       with the intention to suspect.

       “I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a
       most animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knew
       well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention
       really riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to
       memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also
       fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial
       doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper,
       I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented
       the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having
       been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed
       direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original
       fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter
       had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed. I
       bade the Minister good morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a
       gold snuff-box upon the table.

       “The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite
       eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged,
       however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath
       the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful
       screams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D-- rushed to a casement,
       threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to the
       card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by
       a fac-simile, (so far as regards externals,) which I had carefully
       prepared at my lodgings--imitating the D-- cipher, very readily, by
       means of a seal formed of bread.

       “The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic
       behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women
       and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the
       fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When
       he had gone, D-- came from the window, whither I had followed him
       immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade him
       farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.”

       “But what purpose had you,” I asked, “in replacing the letter by a
       fac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have
       seized it openly, and departed?”

       “D--,” replied Dupin, “is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His
       hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had
       I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the
       Ministerial presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard
       of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You
       know my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan of
       the lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his
       power. She has now him in hers--since, being unaware that the letter is
       not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it
       was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political
       destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than
       awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni;
       but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far
       more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have
       no sympathy--at least no pity--for him who descends. He is that monstrum
       horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I
       should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts,
       when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms ‘a certain personage’
       he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the
       card-rack.”

       “How? did you put any thing particular in it?”

       “Why--it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank--that
       would have been insulting. D--, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn,
       which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as
       I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the
       person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a
       clue. He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the
       middle of the blank sheet the words--

       “‘-- -- Un dessein si funeste, S’il n’est digne d’Atrée, est digne de
       Thyeste. They are to be found in Crebillon’s ‘Atrée.’”





       THE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE

                            Truth is stranger than fiction.

                                     OLD SAYING.

       HAVING had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental
       investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsoornot, a work which (like
       the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at all, even in Europe;
       and which has never been quoted, to my knowledge, by any American--if
       we except, perhaps, the author of the “Curiosities of American
       Literature”;--having had occasion, I say, to turn over some pages of the
       first-mentioned very remarkable work, I was not a little astonished to
       discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error
       respecting the fate of the vizier’s daughter, Scheherazade, as that
       fate is depicted in the “Arabian Nights”; and that the denouement there
       given, if not altogether inaccurate, as far as it goes, is at least to
       blame in not having gone very much farther.

       For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the
       inquisitive reader to the “Isitsoornot” itself, but in the meantime, I
       shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I there discovered.

       It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a
       certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not only
       puts her to death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the prophet, to
       espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions, and the
       next morning to deliver her up to the executioner.

       Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with a
       religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him
       as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was interrupted one
       afternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit from his grand vizier, to
       whose daughter, it appears, there had occurred an idea.

       Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would either
       redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty, or perish,
       after the approved fashion of all heroines, in the attempt.

       Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year (which
       makes the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her father, the grand
       vizier, to make an offer to the king of her hand. This hand the king
       eagerly accepts--(he had intended to take it at all events, and had put
       off the matter from day to day, only through fear of the vizier),--but,
       in accepting it now, he gives all parties very distinctly to understand,
       that, grand vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the slightest design
       of giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When, therefore,
       the fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king, and did actually
       marry him despite her father’s excellent advice not to do any thing of
       the kind--when she would and did marry him, I say, will I, nill I, it
       was with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of
       the case would allow.

       It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading
       Machiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in her
       mind. On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I forget what
       specious pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near
       that of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed;
       and, a little before cock-crowing, she took care to awaken the good
       monarch, her husband (who bore her none the worse will because he
       intended to wring her neck on the morrow),--she managed to awaken him, I
       say, (although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion,
       he slept well) by the profound interest of a story (about a rat and a
       black cat, I think) which she was narrating (all in an undertone, of
       course) to her sister. When the day broke, it so happened that this
       history was not altogether finished, and that Scheherazade, in the
       nature of things could not finish it just then, since it was high time
       for her to get up and be bowstrung--a thing very little more pleasant
       than hanging, only a trifle more genteel.

       The king’s curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say, even over
       his sound religious principles, induced him for this once to postpone
       the fulfilment of his vow until next morning, for the purpose and with
       the hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black
       cat (a black cat, I think it was) and the rat.

       The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only put
       the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat was blue)
       but before she well knew what she was about, found herself deep in the
       intricacies of a narration, having reference (if I am not altogether
       mistaken) to a pink horse (with green wings) that went, in a violent
       manner, by clockwork, and was wound up with an indigo key. With this
       history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the
       other--and, as the day broke before its conclusion (notwithstanding
       all the queen’s endeavors to get through with it in time for the
       bowstringing), there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony
       as before, for twenty-four hours. The next night there happened a
       similar accident with a similar result; and then the next--and then
       again the next; so that, in the end, the good monarch, having been
       unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during a
       period of no less than one thousand and one nights, either forgets it
       altogether by the expiration of this time, or gets himself absolved of
       it in the regular way, or (what is more probable) breaks it outright, as
       well as the head of his father confessor. At all events, Scheherazade,
       who, being lineally descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the whole
       seven baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we all know, picked up
       from under the trees in the garden of Eden--Scheherazade, I say, finally
       triumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.

       Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it upon
       record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant--but alas! like
       a great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than true, and I am
       indebted altogether to the “Isitsoornot” for the means of correcting the
       error. “Le mieux,” says a French proverb, “est l’ennemi du bien,” and,
       in mentioning that Scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk,
       I should have added that she put them out at compound interest until
       they amounted to seventy-seven.

       “My dear sister,” said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I quote
       the language of the “Isitsoornot” at this point, verbatim) “my dear
       sister,” said she, “now that all this little difficulty about the
       bowstring has blown over, and that this odious tax is so happily
       repealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great indiscretion in
       withholding from you and the king (who I am sorry to say, snores--a
       thing no gentleman would do) the full conclusion of Sinbad the sailor.
       This person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures
       than those which I related; but the truth is, I felt sleepy on the
       particular night of their narration, and so was seduced into cutting
       them short--a grievous piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that
       Allah will forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to remedy my
       great neglect--and as soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in
       order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noise,
       I will forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases) with the sequel
       of this very remarkable story.”

       Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the
       “Isitsoornot,” expressed no very particular intensity of gratification;
       but the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at length ceased
       snoring, and finally said, “hum!” and then “hoo!” when the queen,
       understanding these words (which are no doubt Arabic) to signify that
       he was all attention, and would do his best not to snore any more--the
       queen, I say, having arranged these matters to her satisfaction,
       re-entered thus, at once, into the history of Sinbad the sailor:

       “‘At length, in my old age,’ [these are the words of Sinbad himself, as
       retailed by Scheherazade]--‘at length, in my old age, and after enjoying
       many years of tranquillity at home, I became once more possessed of a
       desire of visiting foreign countries; and one day, without acquainting
       any of my family with my design, I packed up some bundles of such
       merchandise as was most precious and least bulky, and, engaged a porter
       to carry them, went with him down to the sea-shore, to await the arrival
       of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some
       region which I had not as yet explored.

       “‘Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down beneath some
       trees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship,
       but during several hours we saw none whatever. At length I fancied that
       I could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound; and the porter, after
       listening awhile, declared that he also could distinguish it. Presently
       it grew louder, and then still louder, so that we could have no doubt
       that the object which caused it was approaching us. At length, on
       the edge of the horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidly
       increased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimming
       with a great part of its body above the surface of the sea. It came
       toward us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of foam
       around its breast, and illuminating all that part of the sea through
       which it passed, with a long line of fire that extended far off into the
       distance.

       “‘As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length was equal
       to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and it was as wide as
       the great hall of audience in your palace, O most sublime and munificent
       of the Caliphs. Its body, which was unlike that of ordinary fishes, was
       as solid as a rock, and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portion
       of it which floated above the water, with the exception of a narrow
       blood-red streak that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floated
       beneath the surface, and of which we could get only a glimpse now and
       then as the monster rose and fell with the billows, was entirely covered
       with metallic scales, of a color like that of the moon in misty weather.
       The back was flat and nearly white, and from it there extended upwards
       of six spines, about half the length of the whole body.

       “‘The horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive, but, as if
       to make up for this deficiency, it was provided with at least four
       score of eyes, that protruded from their sockets like those of the green
       dragon-fly, and were arranged all around the body in two rows, one above
       the other, and parallel to the blood-red streak, which seemed to answer
       the purpose of an eyebrow. Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much
       larger than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.

       “‘Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with the
       greatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by necromancy--for
       it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like a duck, nor wings like
       the seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel; nor yet
       did it writhe itself forward as do the eels. Its head and its tail were
       shaped precisely alike, only, not far from the latter, were two small
       holes that served for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed
       out its thick breath with prodigious violence, and with a shrieking,
       disagreeable noise.

       “‘Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but it was
       even surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a nearer look, we
       perceived upon the creature’s back a vast number of animals about the
       size and shape of men, and altogether much resembling them, except that
       they wore no garments (as men do), being supplied (by nature, no doubt)
       with an ugly uncomfortable covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting
       so tight to the skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward,
       and put them apparently to severe pain. On the very tips of their heads
       were certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I thought
       might have been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon discovered
       that they were excessively heavy and solid, and I therefore concluded
       they were contrivances designed, by their great weight, to keep the
       heads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders. Around
       the necks of the creatures were fastened black collars, (badges of
       servitude, no doubt,) such as we keep on our dogs, only much wider
       and infinitely stiffer, so that it was quite impossible for these poor
       victims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body at
       the same time; and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of
       their noses--a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not positively
       in an awful degree.

       “‘When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood, it
       suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and emitted from
       it a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, and
       a noise that I can compare to nothing but thunder. As the smoke cleared
       away, we saw one of the odd man-animals standing near the head of the
       large beast with a trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it to
       his mouth) he presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeable
       accents, that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had they
       not come altogether through the nose.

       “‘Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply, as I
       could in no manner understand what was said; and in this difficulty
       I turned to the porter, who was near swooning through affright, and
       demanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was, what
       it wanted, and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed
       upon its back. To this the porter replied, as well as he could for
       trepidation, that he had once before heard of this sea-beast; that it
       was a cruel demon, with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire, created
       by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind; that the
       things upon its back were vermin, such as sometimes infest cats and
       dogs, only a little larger and more savage; and that these vermin had
       their uses, however evil--for, through the torture they caused the beast
       by their nibbling and stingings, it was goaded into that degree of wrath
       which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill, and so fulfil the
       vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.

       “This account determined me to take to my heels, and, without once even
       looking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the hills, while the
       porter ran equally fast, although nearly in an opposite direction, so
       that, by these means, he finally made his escape with my bundles, of
       which I have no doubt he took excellent care--although this is a point I
       cannot determine, as I do not remember that I ever beheld him again.

       “‘For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin (who
       had come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon overtaken, bound
       hand and foot, and conveyed to the beast, which immediately swam out
       again into the middle of the sea.

       “‘I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to
       peril my life in such adventures as this; but regret being useless, I
       made the best of my condition, and exerted myself to secure the goodwill
       of the man-animal that owned the trumpet, and who appeared to exercise
       authority over his fellows. I succeeded so well in this endeavor that,
       in a few days, the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his
       favor, and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the
       rudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its language; so
       that, at length, I was enabled to converse with it readily, and came to
       make it comprehend the ardent desire I had of seeing the world.

       “‘Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt unt
       grumble, hiss, fiss, whiss,’ said he to me, one day after dinner--but
       I beg a thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your majesty is not
       conversant with the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so the man-animals were
       called; I presume because their language formed the connecting
       link between that of the horse and that of the rooster). With your
       permission, I will translate. ‘Washish squashish,’ and so forth:--that
       is to say, ‘I am happy to find, my dear Sinbad, that you are really a
       very excellent fellow; we are now about doing a thing which is called
       circumnavigating the globe; and since you are so desirous of seeing the
       world, I will strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of
       the beast.’”

       When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the
       “Isitsoornot,” the king turned over from his left side to his right, and
       said:

       “It is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you omitted,
       hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know I think them
       exceedingly entertaining and strange?”

       The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair
       Scheherazade resumed her history in the following words:

       “Sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative to the caliph--‘I
       thanked the man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very much
       at home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean;
       although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the world, by
       no means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we went--so to
       say--either up hill or down hill all the time.’

       “That I think, was very singular,” interrupted the king.

       “Nevertheless, it is quite true,” replied Scheherazade.

       “I have my doubts,” rejoined the king; “but, pray, be so good as to go
       on with the story.”

       “I will,” said the queen. “‘The beast,’ continued Sinbad to the caliph,
       ‘swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at length, we
       arrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in circumference, but
       which, nevertheless, had been built in the middle of the sea by a colony
       of little things like caterpillars’” (*1)

       “Hum!” said the king.

       “‘Leaving this island,’ said Sinbad--(for Scheherazade, it must be
       understood, took no notice of her husband’s ill-mannered ejaculation)
       ‘leaving this island, we came to another where the forests were of solid
       stone, and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finest-tempered axes
       with which we endeavoured to cut them down.”’ (*2)

       “Hum!” said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no attention,
       continued in the language of Sinbad.

       “‘Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where there
       was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the
       bowels of the earth, and that contained a greater number of far more
       spacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all
       Damascus and Bagdad. From the roofs of these palaces there hung myriads
       of gems, like diamonds, but larger than men; and in among the streets
       of towers and pyramids and temples, there flowed immense rivers as black
       as ebony, and swarming with fish that had no eyes.’” (*3)

       “Hum!” said the king. “‘We then swam into a region of the sea where
       we found a lofty mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents of
       melted metal, some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long
       (*4); while from an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a quantity of
       ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens, and it
       became darker than the darkest midnight; so that when we were even at
       the distance of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain, it was
       impossible to see the whitest object, however close we held it to our
       eyes.’” (*5)

       “Hum!” said the king.

       “‘After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until we met
       with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed--for we here
       saw a great lake, at the bottom of which, more than a hundred feet
       beneath the surface of the water, there flourished in full leaf a forest
       of tall and luxuriant trees.’” (*6)

       “Hoo!” said the king.

       “Some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the
       atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our own
       does feather.’” (*7)

       “Fiddle de dee,” said the king.

       “Proceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at the
       most magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there meandered
       a glorious river for several thousands of miles. This river was of
       unspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than that of amber.
       It was from three to six miles in width; and its banks which arose on
       either side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height, were crowned
       with ever-blossoming trees and perpetual sweet-scented flowers, that
       made the whole territory one gorgeous garden; but the name of this
       luxuriant land was the Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it was inevitable
       death’” (*8)

       “Humph!” said the king.

       “‘We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came to
       another, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous
       animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads. These hideous
       beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil, of a funnel shape,
       and line the sides of them with rocks, so disposed one upon the other
       that they fall instantly, when trodden upon by other animals, thus
       precipitating them into the monster’s dens, where their blood is
       immediately sucked, and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously
       out to an immense distance from “the caverns of death.”’” (*9)

       “Pooh!” said the king.

       “‘Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with vegetables that
       grew not upon any soil but in the air. (*10) There were others that
       sprang from the substance of other vegetables; (*11) others that derived
       their substance from the bodies of living animals; (*12) and then again,
       there were others that glowed all over with intense fire; (*13) others
       that moved from place to place at pleasure, (*14) and what was still
       more wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved
       their limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable passion of mankind
       for enslaving other creatures, and confining them in horrid and solitary
       prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks.’” (*15)

       “Pshaw!” said the king.

       “‘Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the bees and
       the birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition, that they
       give daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men
       of the empire. The king of the place having offered a reward for the
       solution of two very difficult problems, they were solved upon the
       spot--the one by the bees, and the other by the birds; but the king
       keeping their solution a secret, it was only after the most profound
       researches and labor, and the writing of an infinity of big books,
       during a long series of years, that the men-mathematicians at length
       arrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by
       the bees and by the birds.’” (*16)

       “Oh my!” said the king.

       “‘We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves
       close upon another, from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock
       of fowls a mile in breadth, and two hundred and forty miles long; so
       that, although they flew a mile during every minute, it required no less
       than four hours for the whole flock to pass over us--in which there were
       several millions of millions of fowl.’” (*17)

       “Oh fy!” said the king.

       “‘No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us great
       annoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of another
       kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs which I met in my
       former voyages; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your
       seraglio, oh, most Munificent of Caliphs. This terrible fowl had no head
       that we could perceive, but was fashioned entirely of belly, which was
       of a prodigious fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance,
       smooth, shining and striped with various colors. In its talons, the
       monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a house from which
       it had knocked off the roof, and in the interior of which we distinctly
       saw human beings, who, beyond doubt, were in a state of frightful
       despair at the horrible fate which awaited them. We shouted with all our
       might, in the hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey,
       but it merely gave a snort or puff, as if of rage and then let fall upon
       our heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand!’”

       “Stuff!” said the king.

       “‘It was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of
       immense extent and prodigious solidity, but which, nevertheless, was
       supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no fewer
       than four hundred horns.’” (*18)

       “That, now, I believe,” said the king, “because I have read something of
       the kind before, in a book.”

       “‘We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in between the
       legs of the cow), and, after some hours, found ourselves in a wonderful
       country indeed, which, I was informed by the man-animal, was his own
       native land, inhabited by things of his own species. This elevated the
       man-animal very much in my esteem, and in fact, I now began to feel
       ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which I had treated him;
       for I found that the man-animals in general were a nation of the most
       powerful magicians, who lived with worms in their brain, (*19) which,
       no doubt, served to stimulate them by their painful writhings and
       wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of imagination!’”

       “Nonsense!” said the king.

       “‘Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of very
       singular kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones were
       iron and whose blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he had black
       stones for his usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard a diet, he was
       so strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the
       grandest temple in this city, at a rate surpassing that of the flight of
       most birds.’” (*20)

       “Twattle!” said the king.

       “‘I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but bigger
       than a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick; her
       blood, like that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she was nearly
       related,) was boiling water; and like him she ate nothing but wood or
       black stones. This hen brought forth very frequently, a hundred chickens
       in the day; and, after birth, they took up their residence for several
       weeks within the stomach of their mother.’” (*21)

       “Fa! lal!” said the king.

       “‘One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of brass and
       wood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would
       have beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with the exception of the
       great Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. (*22) Another of these magi constructed
       (of like material) a creature that put to shame even the genius of him
       who made it; for so great were its reasoning powers that, in a second,
       it performed calculations of so vast an extent that they would have
       required the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year. (*23)
       But a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a mighty thing
       that was neither man nor beast, but which had brains of lead, intermixed
       with a black matter like pitch, and fingers that it employed with such
       incredible speed and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in
       writing out twenty thousand copies of the Koran in an hour, and this
       with so exquisite a precision, that in all the copies there should not
       be found one to vary from another by the breadth of the finest hair.
       This thing was of prodigious strength, so that it erected or overthrew
       the mightiest empires at a breath; but its powers were exercised equally
       for evil and for good.’”

       “Ridiculous!” said the king.

       “‘Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in his
       veins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of sitting
       down to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his dinner was
       thoroughly roasted upon its floor. (*24) Another had the faculty of
       converting the common metals into gold, without even looking at them
       during the process. (*25) Another had such a delicacy of touch that he
       made a wire so fine as to be invisible. (*26) Another had such quickness
       of perception that he counted all the separate motions of an elastic
       body, while it was springing backward and forward at the rate of nine
       hundred millions of times in a second.’” (*27)

       “Absurd!” said the king.

       “‘Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet
       saw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms, kick out
       their legs, fight, or even get up and dance at his will. (*28) Another
       had cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have made
       himself heard from one end of the world to the other. (*29) Another had
       so long an arm that he could sit down in Damascus and indite a letter
       at Bagdad--or indeed at any distance whatsoever. (*30) Another commanded
       the lightning to come down to him out of the heavens, and it came at his
       call; and served him for a plaything when it came. Another took two
       loud sounds and out of them made a silence. Another constructed a
       deep darkness out of two brilliant lights. (*31) Another made ice in a
       red-hot furnace. (*32) Another directed the sun to paint his portrait,
       and the sun did. (*33) Another took this luminary with the moon and the
       planets, and having first weighed them with scrupulous accuracy, probed
       into their depths and found out the solidity of the substance of which
       they were made. But the whole nation is, indeed, of so surprising a
       necromantic ability, that not even their infants, nor their commonest
       cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects that do not exist at
       all, or that for twenty millions of years before the birth of the nation
       itself had been blotted out from the face of creation.”’ (*34)

       “Preposterous!” said the king.

       “‘The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi,’”
        continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner disturbed by
       these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her
       husband--“‘the wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are every
       thing that is accomplished and refined; and would be every thing that is
       interesting and beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them,
       and from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and
       fathers has, hitherto, been adequate to save. Some fatalities come in
       certain shapes, and some in others--but this of which I speak has come
       in the shape of a crotchet.’”

       “A what?” said the king.

       “‘A crotchet’” said Scheherazade. “‘One of the evil genii, who are
       perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into the heads of
       these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal
       beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies
       not very far below the small of the back. Perfection of loveliness, they
       say, is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump. Having been long
       possessed of this idea, and bolsters being cheap in that country, the
       days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman from
       a dromedary-’”

       “Stop!” said the king--“I can’t stand that, and I won’t. You have
       already given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day, too, I
       perceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been married?--my
       conscience is getting to be troublesome again. And then that dromedary
       touch--do you take me for a fool? Upon the whole, you might as well get
       up and be throttled.”

       These words, as I learn from the “Isitsoornot,” both grieved and
       astonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king to be a man of
       scrupulous integrity, and quite unlikely to forfeit his word, she
       submitted to her fate with a good grace. She derived, however, great
       consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from the
       reflection that much of the history remained still untold, and that the
       petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteous
       reward, in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures.




       A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTRÖM.

         The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our
         ways;  nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the
         vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which have
         a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus.

         Joseph Glanville.

       WE had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes the
       old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.

       “Not long ago,” said he at length, “and I could have guided you on this
       route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years past,
       there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man--or
       at least such as no man ever survived to tell of--and the six hours of
       deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul. You
       suppose me a _very_ old man--but I am not. It took less than a single
       day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken
       my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least
       exertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look
       over this little cliff without getting giddy?”

       The “little cliff,” upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself
       down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, while
       he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme
       and slippery edge--this “little cliff” arose, a sheer unobstructed
       precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet
       from the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have tempted me to
       within half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited
       by the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full length
       upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even
       glance upward at the sky--while I struggled in vain to divest myself of
       the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from
       the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason myself into
       sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.

       “You must get over these fancies,” said the guide, “for I have brought
       you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that
       event I mentioned--and to tell you the whole story with the spot just
       under your eye.”

       “We are now,” he continued, in that particularizing manner which
       distinguished him--“we are now close upon the Norwegian coast--in the
       sixty-eighth degree of latitude--in the great province of Nordland--and
       in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon whose top we sit is
       Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little higher--hold on to
       the grass if you feel giddy--so--and look out, beyond the belt of vapor
       beneath us, into the sea.”

       I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore
       so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer’s
       account of the _Mare Tenebrarum_. A panorama more deplorably desolate no
       human imagination can conceive. To the right and left, as far as the eye
       could reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines
       of horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but
       the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against
       its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just
       opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a
       distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible
       a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position was
       discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped.
       About two miles nearer the land, arose another of smaller size,
       hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a
       cluster of dark rocks.

       The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant
       island and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although,
       at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the
       remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly
       plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like a
       regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in
       every direction--as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam
       there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.

       “The island in the distance,” resumed the old man, “is called by
       the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the
       northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven,
       and Buckholm. Farther off--between Moskoe and Vurrgh--are Otterholm,
       Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These are the true names of the
       places--but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all, is
       more than either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything? Do you
       see any change in the water?”

       We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which
       we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no
       glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As the
       old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound,
       like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie;
       and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the _chopping_
       character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current
       which set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired
       a monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed--to its headlong
       impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed
       into ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the
       main uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed
       and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into
       phrensied convulsion--heaving, boiling, hissing--gyrating in gigantic
       and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the
       eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in
       precipitous descents.

       In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical
       alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the
       whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam
       became apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks,
       at length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into
       combination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the
       subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast.
       Suddenly--very suddenly--this assumed a distinct and definite existence,
       in a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was
       represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this
       slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far
       as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of
       water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees,
       speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion,
       and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, half
       roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in
       its agony to Heaven.

       The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw
       myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of
       nervous agitation.

       “This,” said I at length, to the old man--“this _can_ be nothing else
       than the great whirlpool of the Maelström.”

       “So it is sometimes termed,” said he. “We Norwegians call it the
       Moskoe-ström, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.”

       The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me
       for what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most
       circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception either
       of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene--or of the wild
       bewildering sense of _the novel_ which confounds the beholder. I am not
       sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at
       what time; but it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen,
       nor during a storm. There are some passages of his description,
       nevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their
       effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the
       spectacle.

       “Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” he says, “the depth of the water is
       between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver
       (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage
       for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens
       even in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up the
       country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the
       roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest
       and most dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off,
       and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship
       comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down
       to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when
       the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these
       intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood,
       and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence
       gradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury
       heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile
       of it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding
       against it before they were within its reach. It likewise happens
       frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by
       its violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and
       bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A
       bear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the
       stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on
       shore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the
       current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew
       upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks,
       among which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the
       flux and reflux of the sea--it being constantly high and low water every
       six hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday,
       it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the
       houses on the coast fell to the ground.”

       In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have
       been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex. The
       “forty fathoms” must have reference only to portions of the channel
       close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden. The depth in the
       centre of the Moskoe-ström must be immeasurably greater; and no better
       proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the
       sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the
       highest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the
       howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity
       with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of
       belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared to
       me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest ship of the line in
       existence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, could
       resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappear
       bodily and at once.

       The attempts to account for the phenomenon--some of which, I remember,
       seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal--now wore a very
       different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally received is that
       this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Ferroe islands, “have
       no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at flux
       and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the
       water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the
       higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural
       result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which
       is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.”--These are the words of
       the Encyclopædia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the
       centre of the channel of the Maelström is an abyss penetrating the
       globe, and issuing in some very remote part--the Gulf of Bothnia being
       somewhat decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself,
       was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented;
       and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say
       that, although it was the view almost universally entertained of the
       subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the
       former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I
       agreed with him--for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether
       unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.

       “You have had a good look at the whirl now,” said the old man, “and if
       you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden
       the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I
       ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström.”

       I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.

       “Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about
       seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among
       the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent eddies at
       sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only the
       courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we
       three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the
       islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down to
       the southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk,
       and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over here
       among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far
       greater abundance; so that we often got in a single day, what the more
       timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week. In fact, we made
       it a matter of desperate speculation--the risk of life standing instead
       of labor, and courage answering for capital.

       “We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than
       this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of
       the fifteen minutes’ slack to push across the main channel of the
       Moskoe-ström, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage
       somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so
       violent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for
       slack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set
       out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and
       coming--one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return--and
       we seldom made a mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during six
       years, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead
       calm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to
       remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a
       gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too
       boisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been
       driven out to sea in spite of everything, (for the whirlpools threw us
       round and round so violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor
       and dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the
       innumerable cross currents--here to-day and gone to-morrow--which drove
       us under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.

       “I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we
       encountered ‘on the grounds’--it is a bad spot to be in, even in
       good weather--but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the
       Moskoe-ström itself without accident; although at times my heart has
       been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before
       the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at
       starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while
       the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son
       eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have
       been of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as
       afterward in fishing--but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves,
       we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger--for,
       after all is said and done, it _was_ a horrible danger, and that is the
       truth.

       “It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to
       tell you occurred. It was on the tenth day of July, 18-, a day which the
       people of this part of the world will never forget--for it was one
       in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of
       the heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the
       afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west,
       while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us could
       not have foreseen what was to follow.

       “The three of us--my two brothers and myself--had crossed over to the
       islands about two o’clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded the smack
       with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day
       than we had ever known them. It was just seven, _by my watch_, when we
       weighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the Ström at
       slack water, which we knew would be at eight.

       “We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some
       time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed
       we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we
       were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most
       unusual--something that had never happened to us before--and I began to
       feel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on
       the wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was
       upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking
       astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored
       cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.

       “In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we
       were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of
       things, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think about
       it. In less than a minute the storm was upon us--in less than two the
       sky was entirely overcast--and what with this and the driving spray, it
       became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.

       “Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The
       oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it. We had let
       our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the first
       puff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed
       off--the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed
       himself to it for safety.

       “Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water.
       It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and
       this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to
       cross the Ström, by way of precaution against the chopping seas. But for
       this circumstance we should have foundered at once--for we lay entirely
       buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruction I
       cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part,
       as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck,
       with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands
       grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast. It was mere
       instinct that prompted me to do this--which was undoubtedly the very
       best thing I could have done--for I was too much flurried to think.

       “For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this
       time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could stand it no
       longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands,
       and thus got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave herself
       a shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid
       herself, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the
       better of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so
       as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was
       my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure
       that he was overboard--but the next moment all this joy was turned into
       horror--for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word
       ‘_Moskoe-ström!_’

       “No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook
       from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I
       knew what he meant by that one word well enough--I knew what he wished
       to make me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound
       for the whirl of the Ström, and nothing could save us!

       “You perceive that in crossing the Ström _channel_, we always went a
       long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had
       to wait and watch carefully for the slack--but now we were driving right
       upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! ‘To be sure,’ I
       thought, ‘we shall get there just about the slack--there is some little
       hope in that’--but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so great
       a fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we were doomed,
       had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.

       “By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or perhaps
       we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at all events
       the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay flat
       and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular change,
       too, had come over the heavens. Around in every direction it was still
       as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a
       circular rift of clear sky--as clear as I ever saw--and of a deep bright
       blue--and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that
       I never before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing about us with
       the greatest distinctness--but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up!

       “I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother--but, in some
       manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I
       could not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top
       of my voice in his ear. Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as
       death, and held up one of his fingers, as if to say _‘listen! ‘_

       “At first I could not make out what he meant--but soon a hideous thought
       flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not going. I
       glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears as I
       flung it far away into the ocean. _It had run down at seven o’clock!
       We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the Ström was in
       full fury!_

       “When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the
       waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip
       from beneath her--which appears very strange to a landsman--and this is
       what is called _riding_, in sea phrase. Well, so far we had ridden the
       swells very cleverly; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us
       right under the counter, and bore us with it as it rose--up--up--as
       if into the sky. I would not have believed that any wave could rise so
       high. And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge,
       that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty
       mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown a quick
       glance around--and that one glance was all sufficient. I saw our exact
       position in an instant. The Moskoe-Ström whirlpool was about a quarter
       of a mile dead ahead--but no more like the every-day Moskoe-Ström, than
       the whirl as you now see it is like a mill-race. If I had not known
       where we were, and what we had to expect, I should not have recognised
       the place at all. As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror.
       The lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.

       “It could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we
       suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The
       boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new
       direction like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise of
       the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek--such a
       sound as you might imagine given out by the waste-pipes of many thousand
       steam-vessels, letting off their steam all together. We were now in the
       belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course,
       that another moment would plunge us into the abyss--down which we could
       only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we
       wore borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at
       all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge. Her
       starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the world
       of ocean we had left. It stood like a huge writhing wall between us and
       the horizon.

       “It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the
       gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it. Having
       made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of that
       terror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair that strung
       my nerves.

       “It may look like boasting--but what I tell you is truth--I began to
       reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and how
       foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own
       individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God’s power.
       I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind.
       After a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity about
       the whirl itself. I positively felt a _wish_ to explore its depths, even
       at the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was that
       I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the
       mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular fancies to occupy
       a man’s mind in such extremity--and I have often thought since, that the
       revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little
       light-headed.

       “There was another circumstance which tended to restore my
       self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could not
       reach us in our present situation--for, as you saw yourself, the belt of
       surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean, and this
       latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge. If you
       have never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the
       confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together. They
       blind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away all power of action
       or reflection. But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these
       annoyances--just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty
       indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.

       “How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say.
       We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than
       floating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge,
       and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this time I
       had never let go of the ring-bolt. My brother was at the stern, holding
       on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the
       coop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been
       swept overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the brink
       of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from
       which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as
       it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never felt
       deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act--although I knew he
       was a madman when he did it--a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did
       not care, however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make
       no difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have the
       bolt, and went astern to the cask. This there was no great difficulty
       in doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an even
       keel--only swaying to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of
       the whirl. Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when we
       gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I
       muttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.

       “As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively
       tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some seconds
       I dared not open them--while I expected instant destruction, and
       wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water.
       But moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling had
       ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before,
       while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more
       along. I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene.

       “Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration with
       which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by
       magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in
       circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides
       might have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity
       with which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance
       they shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift
       amid the clouds which I have already described, streamed in a flood of
       golden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the inmost
       recesses of the abyss.

       “At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately.
       The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When I
       recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively downward.
       In this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view, from the
       manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool. She
       was quite upon an even keel--that is to say, her deck lay in a plane
       parallel with that of the water--but this latter sloped at an angle of
       more than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our
       beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcely
       more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation,
       than if we had been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose, was owing to
       the speed at which we revolved.

       “The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound
       gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a
       thick mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which there
       hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge which
       Mussulmen say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity. This mist,
       or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of
       the funnel, as they all met together at the bottom--but the yell that
       went up to the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to
       describe.

       “Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above, had
       carried us a great distance down the slope; but our farther descent
       was by no means proportionate. Round and round we swept--not with
       any uniform movement--but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent
       us sometimes only a few hundred yards--sometimes nearly the complete
       circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, was
       slow, but very perceptible.

       “Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were
       thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the
       embrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments of
       vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with
       many smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes,
       barrels and staves. I have already described the unnatural curiosity
       which had taken the place of my original terrors. It appeared to grow
       upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to
       watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our
       company. I _must_ have been delirious--for I even sought _amusement_
       in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents
       toward the foam below. ‘This fir tree,’ I found myself at one time
       saying, ‘will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge
       and disappears,’--and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of
       a Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before. At length, after
       making several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all--this
       fact--the fact of my invariable miscalculation--set me upon a train of
       reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily
       once more.

       “It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more
       exciting _hope_. This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from
       present observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyant
       matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and
       then thrown forth by the Moskoe-ström. By far the greater number of the
       articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way--so chafed
       and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of
       splinters--but then I distinctly recollected that there were _some_ of
       them which were not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this
       difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the
       only ones which had been _completely absorbed_--that the others had
       entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, for some reason,
       had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not reach the
       bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as the case
       might be. I conceived it possible, in either instance, that they might
       thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without undergoing
       the fate of those which had been drawn in more early, or absorbed more
       rapidly. I made, also, three important observations. The first was,
       that, as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid
       their descent--the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the
       one spherical, and the other _of any other shape_, the superiority
       in speed of descent was with the sphere--the third, that, between two
       masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any other
       shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly. Since my escape, I
       have had several conversations on this subject with an old school-master
       of the district; and it was from him that I learned the use of the words
       ‘cylinder’ and ‘sphere.’ He explained to me--although I have forgotten
       the explanation--how what I observed was, in fact, the natural
       consequence of the forms of the floating fragments--and showed me how it
       happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more resistance
       to its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally
       bulky body, of any form whatever. (*1)

       “There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in
       enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to
       account, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed something
       like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of
       these things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes
       upon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed
       to have moved but little from their original station.

       “I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself securely to
       the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the counter,
       and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my brother’s
       attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us,
       and did everything in my power to make him understand what I was about
       to do. I thought at length that he comprehended my design--but, whether
       this was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to
       move from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach him;
       the emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, I
       resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the
       lashings which secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself with
       it into the sea, without another moment’s hesitation.

       “The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is myself
       who now tell you this tale--as you see that I _did_ escape--and as you
       are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected,
       and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say--I will
       bring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been an hour, or
       thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a
       vast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid
       succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at
       once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The barrel to which I
       was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the
       bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before a
       great change took place in the character of the whirlpool. The slope of
       the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep.
       The gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. By
       degrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the
       gulf seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone
       down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I
       found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the shores
       of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the Moskoe-ström
       _had been_. It was the hour of the slack--but the sea still heaved
       in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane. I was borne
       violently into the channel of the Ström, and in a few minutes was
       hurried down the coast into the ‘grounds’ of the fishermen. A boat
       picked me up--exhausted from fatigue--and (now that the danger was
       removed) speechless from the memory of its horror. Those who drew me on
       board were my old mates and daily companions--but they knew me no more
       than they would have known a traveller from the spirit-land. My hair
       which had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you see
       it now. They say too that the whole expression of my countenance had
       changed. I told them my story--they did not believe it. I now tell it
       to _you_--and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did
       the merry fishermen of Lofoden.”




       VON KEMPELEN AND HIS DISCOVERY

       AFTER THE very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say nothing of
       the summary in ‘Silliman’s Journal,’ with the detailed statement just
       published by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be supposed, of course,
       that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to Von Kempelen’s
       discovery, I have any design to look at the subject in a scientific
       point of view. My object is simply, in the first place, to say a few
       words of Von Kempelen himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the
       honor of a slight personal acquaintance), since every thing which
       concerns him must necessarily, at this moment, be of interest; and, in
       the second place, to look in a general way, and speculatively, at the
       results of the discovery.

       It may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations which
       I have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to be a
       general impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this kind, from the
       newspapers), viz.: that this discovery, astounding as it unquestionably
       is, is unanticipated.

       By reference to the ‘Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy’ (Cottle and Munroe,
       London, pp. 150), it will be seen at pp. 53 and 82, that this
       illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question,
       but had actually made no inconsiderable progress, experimentally, in the
       very identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by Von
       Kempelen, who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it, is,
       without doubt (I say it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if required),
       indebted to the ‘Diary’ for at least the first hint of his own
       undertaking.

       The paragraph from the ‘Courier and Enquirer,’ which is now going the
       rounds of the press, and which purports to claim the invention for a
       Mr. Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I confess, a little
       apocryphal, for several reasons; although there is nothing either
       impossible or very improbable in the statement made. I need not go into
       details. My opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its
       manner. It does not look true. Persons who are narrating facts, are
       seldom so particular as Mr. Kissam seems to be, about day and date and
       precise location. Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the
       discovery he says he did, at the period designated--nearly eight years
       ago--how happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the
       immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have
       resulted to him individually, if not to the world at large, from the
       discovery? It seems to me quite incredible that any man of common
       understanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam says he did, and yet
       have subsequently acted so like a baby--so like an owl--as Mr. Kissam
       admits that he did. By-the-way, who is Mr. Kissam? and is not the whole
       paragraph in the ‘Courier and Enquirer’ a fabrication got up to ‘make
       a talk’? It must be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air.
       Very little dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion;
       and if I were not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of
       science are mystified, on points out of their usual range of inquiry,
       I should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as
       Professor Draper, discussing Mr. Kissam’s (or is it Mr. Quizzem’s?)
       pretensions to the discovery, in so serious a tone.

       But to return to the ‘Diary’ of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet was not
       designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the writer, as any
       person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by
       the slightest inspection of the style. At page 13, for example, near the
       middle, we read, in reference to his researches about the protoxide
       of azote: ‘In less than half a minute the respiration being continued,
       diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure
       on all the muscles.’ That the respiration was not ‘diminished,’ is not
       only clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the plural,
       ‘were.’ The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: ‘In less than half
       a minute, the respiration [being continued, these feelings] diminished
       gradually, and were succeeded by [a sensation] analogous to gentle
       pressure on all the muscles.’ A hundred similar instances go to show
       that the MS. so inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book,
       meant only for the writer’s own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet
       will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion.
       The fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about the last man in the world
       to commit himself on scientific topics. Not only had he a more than
       ordinary dislike to quackery, but he was morbidly afraid of appearing
       empirical; so that, however fully he might have been convinced that he
       was on the right track in the matter now in question, he would never
       have spoken out, until he had every thing ready for the most practical
       demonstration. I verily believe that his last moments would have been
       rendered wretched, could he have suspected that his wishes in regard
       to burning this ‘Diary’ (full of crude speculations) would have been
       unattended to; as, it seems, they were. I say ‘his wishes,’ for that he
       meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers directed
       ‘to be burnt,’ I think there can be no manner of doubt. Whether it
       escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad, yet remains to be seen.
       That the passages quoted above, with the other similar ones referred to,
       gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in the slightest degree question;
       but I repeat, it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery
       itself (momentous under any circumstances) will be of service or
       disservice to mankind at large. That Von Kempelen and his immediate
       friends will reap a rich harvest, it would be folly to doubt for a
       moment. They will scarcely be so weak as not to ‘realize,’ in time, by
       large purchases of houses and land, with other property of intrinsic
       value.

       In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the
       ‘Home Journal,’ and has since been extensively copied, several
       misapprehensions of the German original seem to have been made by the
       translator, who professes to have taken the passage from a late number
       of the Presburg ‘Schnellpost.’ ‘Viele’ has evidently been misconceived
       (as it often is), and what the translator renders by ‘sorrows,’ is
       probably ‘lieden,’ which, in its true version, ‘sufferings,’ would give
       a totally different complexion to the whole account; but, of course,
       much of this is merely guess, on my part.

       Von Kempelen, however, is by no means ‘a misanthrope,’ in appearance, at
       least, whatever he may be in fact. My acquaintance with him was casual
       altogether; and I am scarcely warranted in saying that I know him
       at all; but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious a
       notoriety as he has attained, or will attain in a few days, is not a
       small matter, as times go.

       ‘The Literary World’ speaks of him, confidently, as a native of Presburg
       (misled, perhaps, by the account in ‘The Home Journal’) but I am pleased
       in being able to state positively, since I have it from his own lips,
       that he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, although both his
       parents, I believe, are of Presburg descent. The family is connected, in
       some way, with Maelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. In person, he
       is short and stout, with large, fat, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers,
       a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose. There
       is some defect in one of his feet. His address is frank, and his whole
       manner noticeable for bonhomie. Altogether, he looks, speaks, and
       acts as little like ‘a misanthrope’ as any man I ever saw. We were
       fellow-sojourners for a week about six years ago, at Earl’s Hotel, in
       Providence, Rhode Island; and I presume that I conversed with him, at
       various times, for some three or four hours altogether. His principal
       topics were those of the day, and nothing that fell from him led me
       to suspect his scientific attainments. He left the hotel before me,
       intending to go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the latter
       city that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it was
       there that he was first suspected of having made it. This is about all
       that I personally know of the now immortal Von Kempelen; but I have
       thought that even these few details would have interest for the public.

       There can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat
       about this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about as much credit
       as the story of Aladdin’s lamp; and yet, in a case of this kind, as in
       the case of the discoveries in California, it is clear that the truth
       may be stranger than fiction. The following anecdote, at least, is so
       well authenticated, that we may receive it implicitly.

       Von Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence
       at Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been put to extreme
       shifts in order to raise trifling sums. When the great excitement
       occurred about the forgery on the house of Gutsmuth & Co., suspicion
       was directed toward Von Kempelen, on account of his having purchased
       a considerable property in Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, when
       questioned, to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money. He
       was at length arrested, but nothing decisive appearing against him, was
       in the end set at liberty. The police, however, kept a strict watch upon
       his movements, and thus discovered that he left home frequently, taking
       always the same road, and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the
       neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known
       by the flash name of the ‘Dondergat.’ Finally, by dint of great
       perseverance, they traced him to a garret in an old house of seven
       stories, in an alley called Flatzplatz,--and, coming upon him suddenly,
       found him, as they imagined, in the midst of his counterfeiting
       operations. His agitation is represented as so excessive that the
       officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt. After hand-cuffing
       him, they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears he occupied
       all the mansarde.

       Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten feet by
       eight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which the object has
       not yet been ascertained. In one corner of the closet was a very small
       furnace, with a glowing fire in it, and on the fire a kind of duplicate
       crucible--two crucibles connected by a tube. One of these crucibles was
       nearly full of lead in a state of fusion, but not reaching up to the
       aperture of the tube, which was close to the brim. The other crucible
       had some liquid in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to be
       furiously dissipating in vapor. They relate that, on finding himself
       taken, Kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encased
       in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw the
       contents on the tiled floor. It was now that they hand-cuffed him; and
       before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person, but
       nothing unusual was found about him, excepting a paper parcel, in his
       coat-pocket, containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture
       of antimony and some unknown substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal
       proportions. All attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have,
       so far, failed, but that it will ultimately be analyzed, is not to be
       doubted.

       Passing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went through
       a sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was found, to the
       chemist’s sleeping-room. They here rummaged some drawers and boxes,
       but discovered only a few papers, of no importance, and some good coin,
       silver and gold. At length, looking under the bed, they saw a large,
       common hair trunk, without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top lying
       carelessly across the bottom portion. Upon attempting to draw this trunk
       out from under the bed, they found that, with their united strength
       (there were three of them, all powerful men), they ‘could not stir it
       one inch.’ Much astonished at this, one of them crawled under the bed,
       and looking into the trunk, said:

       ‘No wonder we couldn’t move it--why it’s full to the brim of old bits of
       brass!’

       Putting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good purchase,
       and pushing with all his force, while his companions pulled with all
       theirs, the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid out from under the
       bed, and its contents examined. The supposed brass with which it was
       filled was all in small, smooth pieces, varying from the size of a pea
       to that of a dollar; but the pieces were irregular in shape, although
       more or less flat-looking, upon the whole, ‘very much as lead looks when
       thrown upon the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to grow
       cool.’ Now, not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal
       to be any thing but brass. The idea of its being gold never entered
       their brains, of course; how could such a wild fancy have entered it?
       And their astonishment may be well conceived, when the next day it
       became known, all over Bremen, that the ‘lot of brass’ which they
       had carted so contemptuously to the police office, without putting
       themselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not only
       gold--real gold--but gold far finer than any employed in coinage-gold,
       in fact, absolutely pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable
       alloy.

       I need not go over the details of Von Kempelen’s confession (as far as
       it went) and release, for these are familiar to the public. That he has
       actually realized, in spirit and in effect, if not to the letter, the
       old chimaera of the philosopher’s stone, no sane person is at liberty
       to doubt. The opinions of Arago are, of course, entitled to the greatest
       consideration; but he is by no means infallible; and what he says of
       bismuth, in his report to the Academy, must be taken cum grano salis.
       The simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has failed; and
       until Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published
       enigma, it is more than probable that the matter will remain, for years,
       in statu quo. All that as yet can fairly be said to be known is, that
       ‘Pure gold can be made at will, and very readily from lead in connection
       with certain other substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown.’

       Speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results
       of this discovery--a discovery which few thinking persons will hesitate
       in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally,
       by the late developments in California; and this reflection brings us
       inevitably to another--the exceeding inopportuneness of Von Kempelen’s
       analysis. If many were prevented from adventuring to California, by the
       mere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value,
       on account of its plentifulness in the mines there, as to render
       the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one--what
       impression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about to
       emigrate, and especially upon the minds of those actually in the
       mineral region, by the announcement of this astounding discovery of Von
       Kempelen? a discovery which declares, in so many words, that beyond its
       intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes (whatever that worth may be),
       gold now is, or at least soon will be (for it cannot be supposed that
       Von Kempelen can long retain his secret), of no greater value than
       lead, and of far inferior value to silver. It is, indeed, exceedingly
       difficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the
       discovery, but one thing may be positively maintained--that the
       announcement of the discovery six months ago would have had material
       influence in regard to the settlement of California.

       In Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise of two
       hundred per cent. in the price of lead, and nearly twenty-five per cent.
       that of silver.




       MESMERIC REVELATION

        WHATEVER doubt may still envelop the _rationale_ of mesmerism,
       its startling _facts_ are now almost universally admitted. Of these
       latter, those who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession--an
       unprofitable and disreputable tribe. There can be no more absolute waste
       of time than the attempt to _prove_, at the present day, that man, by
       mere exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an
       abnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those
       of _death_, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the
       phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that,
       while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort,
       and then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with
       keenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown,
       matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his
       intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his
       sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound; and, finally,
       that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency,
       while, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited are more
       extended and more _pronounced_.

        I say that these--which are the laws of mesmerism in its
       general features--it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I
       inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration; to-day. My purpose
       at present is a very different one indeed. I am impelled, even in
       the teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very
       remarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and
       myself.

        I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in
       question, (Mr. Vankirk,) and the usual acute susceptibility and
       exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened. For many months he
       had been laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more distressing effects
       of which had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night of
       Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside.

        The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the
       heart, and breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary
       symptoms of asthma. In spasms such as these he had usually found relief
       from the application of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-night
       this had been attempted in vain.

        As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and
       although evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite
       at ease.

        “I sent for you to-night,” he said, “not so much to administer
       to my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal
       impressions which, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and
       surprise. I need not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the
       topic of the soul’s immortality. I cannot deny that there has always
       existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague
       half-sentiment of its own existence. But this half-sentiment at no
       time amounted to conviction. With it my reason had nothing to do.
       All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more
       sceptical than before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied
       him in his own works as well as in those of his European and American
       echoes. The ‘Charles Elwood’ of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placed
       in my hands. I read it with profound attention. Throughout I found it
       logical, but the portions which were not _merely_ logical were unhappily
       the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his
       summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even
       succeeded in convincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten his
       beginning, like the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in
       perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own
       immortality, he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions
       which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of England, of
       France, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no
       hold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded,
       will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The
       will may assent--the soul--the intellect, never.

        “I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually
       believed. But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the
       feeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of
       reason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two. I am
       enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence.
       I cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the
       mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination
       which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full
       accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through
       its _effect_, into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning
       and its conclusion--the cause and its effect--are present together. In
       my natural state, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only
       partially, remains.

        “These considerations have led me to think that some good
       results might ensue from a series of well-directed questions
       propounded to me while mesmerized. You have often observed the profound
       self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker--the extensive knowledge he
       displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and
       from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of
       a catechism.”

        I consented of course to make this experiment.  A few passes
       threw Mr. Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep. His breathing became
       immediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness.
       The following conversation then ensued:--V. in the dialogue representing
       the patient, and P. myself.

       _ P._ Are you asleep?

       _ V._ Yes--no I would rather sleep more soundly.

       _P._ [_After a few more passes._] Do you sleep now?

       _V._ Yes.

       _P._ How do you think your present illness will result?

       _V._ [_After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort_.] I must
       die.

       _P._ Does the idea of death afflict you?

       _V._ [_Very quickly_.] No--no!

       _P._ Are you pleased with the prospect?

       _V._ If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no matter. The
       mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.

       _P._ I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.

       _V._ I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I feel able
       to make. You do not question me properly.

       _P._ What then shall I ask?

       _V._ You must begin at the beginning.

       _P._ The beginning! but where is the beginning?

       _V._ You know that the beginning is GOD. [_This was said in a low,
       fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound veneration_.]

       _P._ What then is God?

       _V._ [_Hesitating for many minutes._] I cannot tell.

       _P._ Is not God spirit?

       _V._ While I was awake I knew what you meant by “spirit,” but now it
       seems only a word--such for instance as truth, beauty--a quality, I
       mean.

       _P._ Is not God immaterial?

       _V._ There is no immateriality--it is a mere word. That which is not
       matter, is not at all--unless qualities are things.

       _P._ Is God, then, material?

       _V._ No. [_This reply startled me very much._]

       _P._ What then is he?

       _V._ [_After a long pause, and mutteringly._] I see--but it is a thing
       difficult to tell. [_Another long pause._] He is not spirit, for
       he exists. Nor is he matter, as _you understand it_. But there are
       _gradations_ of matter of which man knows nothing; the grosser impelling
       the finer, the finer pervading the grosser. The atmosphere, for example,
       impels the electric principle, while the electric principle permeates
       the atmosphere. These gradations of matter increase in rarity
       or fineness, until we arrive at a matter _unparticled_--without
       particles--indivisible--_one_ and here the law of impulsion and
       permeation is modified. The ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only
       permeates all things but impels all things--and thus _is_ all things
       within itself. This matter is God. What men attempt to embody in the
       word “thought,” is this matter in motion.

       _P._ The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion
       and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the former.

       _V._ Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is the action
       of _mind_--not of _thinking_. The unparticled matter, or God, in
       quiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call mind. And
       the power of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human volition) is,
       in the unparticled matter, the result of its unity and omniprevalence;
       _how_ I know not, and now clearly see that I shall never know. But the
       unparticled matter, set in motion by a law, or quality, existing within
       itself, is thinking.

       _P._ Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the
       unparticled matter?

       _V._ The matters of which man is cognizant, escape the senses in
       gradation. We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of
       water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous
       ether. Now we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter in
       one general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideas
       more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and that
       which we attach to the luminiferous ether. When we reach the latter, we
       feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with
       nihility. The only consideration which restrains us is our conception
       of its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from
       our notion of an atom, as something possessing in infinite minuteness,
       solidity, palpability, weight. Destroy the idea of the atomic
       constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an
       entity, or at least as matter. For want of a better word we might term
       it spirit. Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous ether--conceive a
       matter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare than
       the metal, and we arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at
       a unique mass--an unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinite
       littleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the
       spaces between them is an absurdity. There will be a point--there will
       be a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous,
       the interspaces must vanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce. But
       the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away, the
       nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. It
       is clear, however, that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is,
       it is impossible to conceive spirit, since it is impossible to
       imagine what is not. When we flatter ourselves that we have formed
       its conception, we have merely deceived our understanding by the
       consideration of infinitely rarified matter.

       _P._ There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea
       of absolute coalescence;--and that is the very slight resistance
       experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space--a
       resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in _some_ degree, but
       which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite overlooked by
       the sagacity even of Newton. We know that the resistance of bodies
       is, chiefly, in proportion to their density. Absolute coalescence
       is absolute density. Where there are no interspaces, there can be no
       yielding. An ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more
       effectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant
       or of iron.

       _V._ Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the
       ratio of its apparent unanswerability.--As regards the progress of the
       star, it can make no difference whether the star passes through the
       ether _or the ether through it_. There is no astronomical error more
       unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the
       comets with the idea of their passage through an ether: for, however
       rare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal
       revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those
       astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found
       it impossible to comprehend. The retardation actually experienced is, on
       the other hand, about that which might be expected from the _friction_
       of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb. In the one
       case, the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself--in
       the other it is endlessly accumulative.

       _P._ But in all this--in this identification of mere matter with God--is
       there nothing of irreverence? [_I was forced to repeat this question
       before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning_.]

       _V._ Can you say _why_ matter should be less reverenced than mind? But
       you forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all respects, the
       very “mind” or “spirit” of the schools, so far as regards its high
       capacities, and is, moreover, the “matter” of these schools at the
       same time. God, with all the powers attributed to spirit, is but the
       perfection of matter.

       _P._ You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is
       thought?

       _V._ In general, this motion is the universal thought of the universal
       mind. This thought creates. All created things are but the thoughts of
       God.

       _P._ You say, “in general.”

       _V._ Yes. The universal mind is God. For new individualities, _matter_
       is necessary.

       _P._ But you now speak of “mind” and “matter” as do the metaphysicians.

       _V._ Yes--to avoid confusion. When I say “mind,” I mean the unparticled
       or ultimate matter; by “matter,” I intend all else.

       _P._ You were saying that “for new individualities matter is necessary.”

       _V._ Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God. To create
       individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions
       of the divine mind. Thus man is individualized. Divested of corporate
       investiture, he were God. Now, the particular motion of the incarnated
       portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man; as the motion
       of the whole is that of God.

       _P._ You say that divested of the body man will be God?

       _V._ [_After much hesitation._] I could not have said this; it is an
       absurdity.

       _P._ [_Referring to my notes._] You _did_ say that “divested of
       corporate investiture man were God.”

       _V._ And this is true. Man thus divested _would be_ God--would be
       unindividualized. But he can never be thus divested--at least never
       _will be_--else we must imagine an action of God returning upon
       itself--a purposeless and futile action. Man is a creature. Creatures
       are thoughts of God. It is the nature of thought to be irrevocable.

       _P._ I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the body?

       _V._ I say that he will never be bodiless.

       _P._ Explain.

       _V._ There are two bodies--the rudimental and the complete;
       corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly.
       What we call “death,” is but the painful metamorphosis. Our present
       incarnation is progressive, preparatory, temporary. Our future is
       perfected, ultimate, immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.

       _P._ But of the worm’s metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.

       _V._ _We_, certainly--but not the worm. The matter of which our
       rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that
       body; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the
       matter of which is formed the rudimental body; but not to that of which
       the ultimate is composed. The ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental
       senses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, in decaying, from
       the inner form; not that inner form itself; but this inner form, as
       well as the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired the
       ultimate life.

       _P._ You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles
       death. How is this?

       _V._ When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles the
       ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental
       life are in abeyance, and I perceive external things directly,
       without organs, through a medium which I shall employ in the ultimate,
       unorganized life.

       _P._ Unorganized?

       _V._ Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought
       into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter, to
       the exclusion of other classes and forms. The organs of man are adapted
       to his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition,
       being unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but
       one--the nature of the volition of God--that is to say, the motion of
       the unparticled matter. You will have a distinct idea of the ultimate
       body by conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is _not_; but a
       conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it
       _is_. A luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether.
       The vibrations generate similar ones within the retina; these again
       communicate similar ones to the optic nerve. The nerve conveys similar
       ones to the brain; the brain, also, similar ones to the unparticled
       matter which permeates it. The motion of this latter is thought, of
       which perception is the first undulation. This is the mode by which the
       mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world; and
       this external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the
       idiosyncrasy of its organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized life, the
       external world reaches the whole body, (which is of a substance having
       affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no other intervention than that
       of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous; and to this
       ether--in unison with it--the whole body vibrates, setting in motion
       the unparticled matter which permeates it. It is to the absence of
       idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute the nearly
       unlimited perception of the ultimate life. To rudimental beings, organs
       are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged.

       _P._ You speak of rudimental “beings.” Are there other rudimental
       thinking beings than man?

       _V._ The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulæ,
       planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulæ, suns,
       nor planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying _pabulum_ for the
       idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings. But for
       the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, there
       would have been no bodies such as these. Each of these is tenanted by a
       distinct variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures. In all,
       the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted. At death,
       or metamorphosis, these creatures, enjoying the ultimate
       life--immortality--and cognizant of all secrets but _the one_, act all
       things and pass everywhere by mere volition:--indwelling, not the stars,
       which to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation
       of which we blindly deem space created--but that SPACE itself--that
       infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the
       star-shadows--blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of
       the angels.

       _P._ You say that “but for the _necessity_ of the rudimental life” there
       would have been no stars. But why this necessity?

       _V._ In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter
       generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple _unique_
       law--the Divine Volition. With the view of producing impediment, the
       organic life and matter, (complex, substantial, and law-encumbered,)
       were contrived.

       _P._ But again--why need this impediment have been produced?

       _V._ The result of law inviolate is perfection--right--negative
       happiness. The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive
       pain. Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, and
       substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation of
       law is rendered, to a certain extent, practicable. Thus pain, which in
       the inorganic life is impossible, is possible in the organic.

       _P._ But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?

       _V._ All things are either good or bad by comparison. A sufficient
       analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast of
       pain. _Positive_ pleasure is a mere idea. To be happy at any one point
       we must have suffered at the same. Never to suffer would have been never
       to have been blessed. But it has been shown that, in the inorganic
       life, pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic. The pain of the
       primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate
       life in Heaven.

       _P._ Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it impossible
       to comprehend--“the truly _substantive_ vastness of infinity.”

       _V._ This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic
       conception of the term “_substance_” itself. We must not regard it as a
       quality, but as a sentiment:--it is the perception, in thinking beings,
       of the adaptation of matter to their organization. There are many things
       on the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus--many
       things visible and tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought
       to appreciate as existing at all. But to the inorganic beings--to the
       angels--the whole of the unparticled matter is substance--that is
       to say, the whole of what we term “space” is to them the truest
       substantiality;--the stars, meantime, through what we consider their
       materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion as the
       unparticled matter, through what we consider its immateriality, eludes
       the organic.

         As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone,
       I observed on his countenance a singular expression, which somewhat
       alarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once. No sooner had I done
       this, than, with a bright smile irradiating all his features, he fell
       back upon his pillow and expired. I noticed that in less than a minute
       afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone. His brow was
       of the coldness of ice. Thus, ordinarily, should it have appeared, only
       after long pressure from Azrael’s hand. Had the sleep-waker, indeed,
       during the latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out
       the region of the shadows?




       THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M. VALDEMAR

       OF course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder, that
       the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited discussion. It would
       have been a miracle had it not-especially under the circumstances.
       Through the desire of all parties concerned, to keep the affair from the
       public, at least for the present, or until we had farther opportunities
       for investigation--through our endeavors to effect this--a garbled or
       exaggerated account made its way into society, and became the source of
       many unpleasant misrepresentations, and, very naturally, of a great deal
       of disbelief.

       It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts--as far as I
       comprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:

       My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to
       the subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago it occurred to me,
       quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there
       had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission:--no person
       had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis. It remained to be seen,
       first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any
       susceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any
       existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what
       extent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be
       arrested by the process. There were other points to be ascertained,
       but these most excited my curiosity--the last in especial, from the
       immensely important character of its consequences.

       In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these
       particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar,
       the well-known compiler of the “Bibliotheca Forensica,” and author
       (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the Polish versions of
       “Wallenstein” and “Gargantua.” M. Valdemar, who has resided principally
       at Harlaem, N.Y., since the year 1839, is (or was) particularly
       noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person--his lower limbs much
       resembling those of John Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his
       whiskers, in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair--the latter,
       in consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His temperament
       was markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric
       experiment. On two or three occasions I had put him to sleep with little
       difficulty, but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar
       constitution had naturally led me to anticipate. His will was at no
       period positively, or thoroughly, under my control, and in regard to
       clairvoyance, I could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon. I
       always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of
       his health. For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with
       him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis. It was his
       custom, indeed, to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution, as of a
       matter neither to be avoided nor regretted.

       When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it was
       of course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I knew the
       steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples
       from him; and he had no relatives in America who would be likely to
       interfere. I spoke to him frankly upon the subject; and, to my surprise,
       his interest seemed vividly excited. I say to my surprise, for, although
       he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments, he had never
       before given me any tokens of sympathy with what I did. His disease was
       of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect
       to the epoch of its termination in death; and it was finally arranged
       between us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the
       period announced by his physicians as that of his decease.

       It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M.
       Valdemar himself, the subjoined note:

       My DEAR P---,

       You may as well come now. D---- and F---- are agreed that I cannot hold out
       beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the time very
       nearly.

       VALDEMAR

       I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in
       fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man’s chamber. I had not seen
       him for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the
       brief interval had wrought in him. His face wore a leaden hue; the eyes
       were utterly lustreless; and the emaciation was so extreme that the
       skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was
       excessive. The pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless,
       in a very remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degree
       of physical strength. He spoke with distinctness--took some palliative
       medicines without aid--and, when I entered the room, was occupied in
       penciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was propped up in the bed by
       pillows. Doctors D---- and F---- were in attendance.

       After pressing Valdemar’s hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and
       obtained from them a minute account of the patient’s condition. The left
       lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginous
       state, and was, of course, entirely useless for all purposes of
       vitality. The right, in its upper portion, was also partially, if
       not thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region was merely a mass
       of purulent tubercles, running one into another. Several extensive
       perforations existed; and, at one point, permanent adhesion to the
       ribs had taken place. These appearances in the right lobe were of
       comparatively recent date. The ossification had proceeded with very
       unusual rapidity; no sign of it had been discovered a month before, and
       the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days.
       Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of aneurism
       of the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact
       diagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of both physicians that M.
       Valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow (Sunday). It was then
       seven o’clock on Saturday evening.

       On quitting the invalid’s bed-side to hold conversation with myself,
       Doctors D---- and F---- had bidden him a final farewell. It had not been their
       intention to return; but, at my request, they agreed to look in upon the
       patient about ten the next night.

       When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the subject
       of his approaching dissolution, as well as, more particularly, of the
       experiment proposed. He still professed himself quite willing and even
       anxious to have it made, and urged me to commence it at once. A male and
       a female nurse were in attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether
       at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable
       witnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove.
       I therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night, when
       the arrival of a medical student with whom I had some acquaintance, (Mr.
       Theodore L--l,) relieved me from farther embarrassment. It had been my
       design, originally, to wait for the physicians; but I was induced to
       proceed, first, by the urgent entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly,
       by my conviction that I had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently
       sinking fast.

       Mr. L--l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes
       of all that occurred, and it is from his memoranda that what I now have
       to relate is, for the most part, either condensed or copied verbatim.

       It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient’s hand, I
       begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L--l, whether he
       (M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment of
       mesmerizing him in his then condition.

       He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, “Yes, I wish to be. I fear you
       have mesmerized”--adding immediately afterwards, “deferred it too long.”

       While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already found
       most effectual in subduing him. He was evidently influenced with the
       first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but although I
       exerted all my powers, no further perceptible effect was induced
       until some minutes after ten o’clock, when Doctors D-- and F-- called,
       according to appointment. I explained to them, in a few words, what I
       designed, and as they opposed no objection, saying that the patient was
       already in the death agony, I proceeded without hesitation--exchanging,
       however, the lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze
       entirely into the right eye of the sufferer.

       By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was
       stertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.

       This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At the
       expiration of this period, however, a natural although a very deep
       sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous breathing
       ceased--that is to say, its stertorousness was no longer apparent; the
       intervals were undiminished. The patient’s extremities were of an icy
       coldness.

       At five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of the
       mesmeric influence. The glassy roll of the eye was changed for that
       expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in
       cases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite impossible to mistake.
       With a few rapid lateral passes I made the lids quiver, as in incipient
       sleep, and with a few more I closed them altogether. I was not
       satisfied, however, with this, but continued the manipulations
       vigorously, and with the fullest exertion of the will, until I had
       completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer, after placing them in
       a seemingly easy position. The legs were at full length; the arms were
       nearly so, and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin.
       The head was very slightly elevated.

       When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requested
       the gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar’s condition. After a few
       experiments, they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of
       mesmeric trance. The curiosity of both the physicians was greatly
       excited. Dr. D---- resolved at once to remain with the patient all
       night, while Dr. F---- took leave with a promise to return at daybreak.
       Mr. L--l and the nurses remained.

       We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o’clock in
       the morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the same
       condition as when Dr. F--went away--that is to say, he lay in the
       same position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle
       (scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the
       lips); the eyes were closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and
       as cold as marble. Still, the general appearance was certainly not that
       of death.

       As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influence
       his right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the latter gently
       to and fro above his person. In such experiments with this patient I had
       never perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly I had little thought of
       succeeding now; but to my astonishment, his arm very readily, although
       feebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine. I determined
       to hazard a few words of conversation.

       “M. Valdemar,” I said, “are you asleep?” He made no answer, but I
       perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat the
       question, again and again. At its third repetition, his whole frame was
       agitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids unclosed themselves so
       far as to display a white line of the ball; the lips moved sluggishly,
       and from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words:

       “Yes;--asleep now. Do not wake me!--let me die so!”

       I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right arm,
       as before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the sleep-waker
       again:

       “Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?”

       The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before: “No
       pain--I am dying.”

       I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then, and
       nothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F--, who came a
       little before sunrise, and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding
       the patient still alive. After feeling the pulse and applying a mirror
       to the lips, he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again. I did
       so, saying:

       “M. Valdemar, do you still sleep?”

       As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during the
       interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak.
       At my fourth repetition of the question, he said very faintly, almost
       inaudibly:

       “Yes; still asleep--dying.”

       It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians, that
       M. Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present
       apparently tranquil condition, until death should supervene--and this,
       it was generally agreed, must now take place within a few minutes. I
       concluded, however, to speak to him once more, and merely repeated my
       previous question.

       While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of
       the sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupils
       disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue,
       resembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the circular hectic
       spots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre of each
       cheek, went out at once. I use this expression, because the
       suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the
       extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath. The upper lip,
       at the same time, writhed itself away from the teeth, which it had
       previously covered completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible
       jerk, leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view the
       swollen and blackened tongue. I presume that no member of the party
       then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors; but so hideous
       beyond conception was the appearance of M. Valdemar at this moment, that
       there was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed.

       I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which every
       reader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my business,
       however, simply to proceed.

       There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; and
       concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of the
       nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue.
       This continued for perhaps a minute. At the expiration of this period,
       there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice--such as it
       would be madness in me to attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or
       three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I
       might say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hollow;
       but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason that no
       similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity. There were two
       particulars, nevertheless, which I thought then, and still think, might
       fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation--as well adapted to
       convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, the
       voice seemed to reach our ears--at least mine--from a vast distance,
       or from some deep cavern within the earth. In the second place, it
       impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make myself
       comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of
       touch.

       I have spoken both of “sound” and of “voice.” I mean to say that
       the sound was one of distinct--of even wonderfully, thrillingly
       distinct--syllabification. M. Valdemar spoke--obviously in reply to the
       question I had propounded to him a few minutes before. I had asked him,
       it will be remembered, if he still slept. He now said:

       “Yes;--no;--I have been sleeping--and now--now--I am dead.”

       No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress, the
       unutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus uttered, were
       so well calculated to convey. Mr. L--l (the student) swooned. The nurses
       immediately left the chamber, and could not be induced to return. My own
       impressions I would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader.
       For nearly an hour, we busied ourselves, silently--without the utterance
       of a word--in endeavors to revive Mr. L--l. When he came to himself,
       we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of M. Valdemar’s
       condition.

       It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the
       exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration. An
       attempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I should mention, too, that
       this limb was no farther subject to my will. I endeavored in vain to
       make it follow the direction of my hand. The only real indication,
       indeed, of the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory
       movement of the tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question.
       He seemed to be making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient
       volition. To queries put to him by any other person than myself he
       seemed utterly insensible--although I endeavored to place each member
       of the company in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have now
       related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker’s
       state at this epoch. Other nurses were procured; and at ten o’clock I
       left the house in company with the two physicians and Mr. L--l.

       In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His condition
       remained precisely the same. We had now some discussion as to the
       propriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had little difficulty
       in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing. It was
       evident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed death) had been
       arrested by the mesmeric process. It seemed clear to us all that to
       awaken M. Valdemar would be merely to insure his instant, or at least
       his speedy dissolution.

       From this period until the close of last week--an interval of nearly
       seven months--we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar’s house,
       accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends. All this time
       the sleeper-waker remained exactly as I have last described him. The
       nurses’ attentions were continual.

       It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment
       of awakening or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps)
       unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to
       so much discussion in private circles--to so much of what I cannot help
       thinking unwarranted popular feeling.

       For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric trance, I
       made use of the customary passes. These, for a time, were unsuccessful.
       The first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the
       iris. It was observed, as especially remarkable, that this lowering
       of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish
       ichor (from beneath the lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.

       It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patient’s
       arm, as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr. F--then intimated
       a desire to have me put a question. I did so, as follows:

       “M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes
       now?”

       There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks; the
       tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth (although the
       jaws and lips remained rigid as before;) and at length the same hideous
       voice which I have already described, broke forth:

       “For God’s sake!--quick!--quick!--put me to sleep--or, quick!--waken
       me!--quick!--I say to you that I am dead!”

       I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided what to
       do. At first I made an endeavor to re-compose the patient; but, failing
       in this through total abeyance of the will, I retraced my steps and as
       earnestly struggled to awaken him. In this attempt I soon saw that I
       should be successful--or at least I soon fancied that my success would
       be complete--and I am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the
       patient awaken.

       For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that any human
       being could have been prepared.

       As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of “dead!
       dead!” absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the
       sufferer, his whole frame at once--within the space of a single minute,
       or even less, shrunk--crumbled--absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.
       Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass
       of loathsome--of detestable putridity.




       THE BLACK CAT.

       FOR the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I
       neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it,
       in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I
       not--and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day
       I would unburthen my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before
       the world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of
       mere household events. In their consequences, these events have
       terrified--have tortured--have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to
       expound them. To me, they have presented little but Horror--to many
       they will seem less terrible than _barroques_. Hereafter, perhaps,
       some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the
       common-place--some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less
       excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I
       detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very
       natural causes and effects.

       From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my
       disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make
       me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was
       indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent
       most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing
       them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my
       manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To
       those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious
       dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the
       intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the
       unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly
       to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry
       friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere _Man_.

       I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not
       uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she
       lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We
       had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and _a cat_.

       This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black,
       and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence,
       my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition,
       made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all
       black cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever _serious_ upon
       this point--and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than
       that it happens, just now, to be remembered.

       Pluto--this was the cat’s name--was my favorite pet and playmate. I
       alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It
       was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me
       through the streets.

       Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which
       my general temperament and character--through the instrumentality of the
       Fiend Intemperance--had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical
       alteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more
       irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself
       to use intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered her
       personal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change
       in my disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For
       Pluto, however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from
       maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the
       monkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they
       came in my way. But my disease grew upon me--for what disease is like
       Alcohol!--and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and
       consequently somewhat peevish--even Pluto began to experience the
       effects of my ill temper.

       One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about
       town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him; when, in
       his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with
       his teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself
       no longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my
       body and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every
       fibre of my frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened
       it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of
       its eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the
       damnable atrocity.

       When reason returned with the morning--when I had slept off the fumes of
       the night’s debauch--I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of
       remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best,
       a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I again
       plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.

       In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost eye
       presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared
       to suffer any pain. He went about the house as usual, but, as might be
       expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. I had so much of my
       old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on
       the part of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling
       soon gave place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final and
       irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS. Of this spirit
       philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives,
       than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the
       human heart--one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments,
       which give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundred
       times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other
       reason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual
       inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which
       is _Law_, merely because we understand it to be such? This spirit
       of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was this
       unfathomable longing of the soul _to vex itself_--to offer violence to
       its own nature--to do wrong for the wrong’s sake only--that urged me to
       continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the
       unoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about
       its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;--hung it with the
       tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my
       heart;--hung it _because_ I knew that it had loved me, and _because_
       I felt it had given me no reason of offence;--hung it _because_ I knew
       that in so doing I was committing a sin--a deadly sin that would
       so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it--if such a thing wore
       possible--even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most
       Merciful and Most Terrible God.

       On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused
       from sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed were in flames.
       The whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife,
       a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration. The
       destruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and
       I resigned myself thenceforward to despair.

       I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause
       and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a
       chain of facts--and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect.
       On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. The walls, with
       one exception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartment
       wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and
       against which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here,
       in great measure, resisted the action of the fire--a fact which I
       attributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall a
       dense crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a
       particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The
       words “strange!” “singular!” and other similar expressions, excited my
       curiosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in _bas relief_ upon the
       white surface, the figure of a gigantic _cat_. The impression was given
       with an accuracy truly marvellous. There was a rope about the animal’s
       neck.

       When I first beheld this apparition--for I could scarcely regard it as
       less--my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length reflection
       came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden
       adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been
       immediately filled by the crowd--by some one of whom the animal must
       have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my
       chamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me
       from sleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my
       cruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of
       which, with the flames, and the _ammonia_ from the carcass, had then
       accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.

       Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my
       conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the less
       fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For months I could not rid
       myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came
       back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse.
       I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me,
       among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet
       of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to
       supply its place.

       One night as I sat, half stupified, in a den of more than infamy, my
       attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon
       the head of one of the immense hogsheads of Gin, or of Rum, which
       constituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had been looking
       steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now
       caused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived the
       object thereupon. I approached it, and touched it with my hand. It was
       a black cat--a very large one--fully as large as Pluto, and closely
       resembling him in every respect but one. Pluto had not a white hair upon
       any portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite
       splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast. Upon
       my touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against my
       hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This, then, was the very
       creature of which I was in search. I at once offered to purchase it
       of the landlord; but this person made no claim to it--knew nothing of
       it--had never seen it before.

       I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animal
       evinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to do so;
       occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When it reached
       the house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great
       favorite with my wife.

       For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. This
       was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but--I know not how
       or why it was--its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and
       annoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose
       into the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the creature; a certain sense
       of shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing
       me from physically abusing it. I did not, for some weeks, strike, or
       otherwise violently ill use it; but gradually--very gradually--I came
       to look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its
       odious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.

       What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on
       the morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been
       deprived of one of its eyes. This circumstance, however, only endeared
       it to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree,
       that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait,
       and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.

       With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed
       to increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would
       be difficult to make the reader comprehend. Whenever I sat, it would
       crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with its
       loathsome caresses. If I arose to walk it would get between my feet and
       thus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my
       dress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast. At such times, although
       I longed to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing,
       partly by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly--let me confess it at
       once--by absolute dread of the beast.

       This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil--and yet I should be
       at a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost ashamed to own--yes,
       even in this felon’s cell, I am almost ashamed to own--that the terror
       and horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened by one
       of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive. My wife had
       called my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of
       white hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole
       visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had
       destroyed. The reader will remember that this mark, although large, had
       been originally very indefinite; but, by slow degrees--degrees nearly
       imperceptible, and which for a long time my Reason struggled to reject
       as fanciful--it had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of
       outline. It was now the representation of an object that I shudder to
       name--and for this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have
       rid myself of the monster _had I dared_--it was now, I say, the image
       of a hideous--of a ghastly thing--of the GALLOWS!--oh, mournful and
       terrible engine of Horror and of Crime--of Agony and of Death!

       And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity.
       And _a brute beast _--whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed--_a
       brute beast_ to work out for _me_--for me a man, fashioned in the image
       of the High God--so much of insufferable wo! Alas! neither by day nor
       by night knew I the blessing of Rest any more! During the former the
       creature left me no moment alone; and, in the latter, I started, hourly,
       from dreams of unutterable fear, to find the hot breath of _the thing_
       upon my face, and its vast weight--an incarnate Night-Mare that I had no
       power to shake off--incumbent eternally upon my _heart!_

       Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant
       of the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my sole
       intimates--the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The moodiness of
       my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind;
       while, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury
       to which I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas!
       was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers.

       One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar
       of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. The cat
       followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong,
       exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my
       wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a
       blow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal
       had it descended as I wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of
       my wife. Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal,
       I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain. She
       fell dead upon the spot, without a groan.

       This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with
       entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I knew that I
       could not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without
       the risk of being observed by the neighbors. Many projects entered
       my mind. At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute
       fragments, and destroying them by fire. At another, I resolved to dig
       a grave for it in the floor of the cellar. Again, I deliberated about
       casting it in the well in the yard--about packing it in a box, as if
       merchandize, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to
       take it from the house. Finally I hit upon what I considered a far
       better expedient than either of these. I determined to wall it up in the
       cellar--as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up
       their victims.

       For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were
       loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a
       rough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from
       hardening. Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by
       a false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to
       resemble the red of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily
       displace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole
       up as before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. And in
       this calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I easily
       dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body against
       the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with little
       trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood. Having
       procured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution, I
       prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, and
       with this I very carefully went over the new brickwork. When I had
       finished, I felt satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present
       the slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on
       the floor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around
       triumphantly, and said to myself--“Here at least, then, my labor has not
       been in vain.”

       My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so
       much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to
       death. Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have
       been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had
       been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to
       present itself in my present mood. It is impossible to describe, or to
       imagine, the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the
       detested creature occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its
       appearance during the night--and thus for one night at least, since its
       introduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept
       even with the burden of murder upon my soul!

       The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not.
       Once again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror, had fled the
       premises forever! I should behold it no more! My happiness was supreme!
       The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. Some few inquiries
       had been made, but these had been readily answered. Even a search had
       been instituted--but of course nothing was to be discovered. I looked
       upon my future felicity as secured.

       Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came,
       very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous
       investigation of the premises. Secure, however, in the inscrutability of
       my place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. The officers
       bade me accompany them in their search. They left no nook or corner
       unexplored. At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into
       the cellar. I quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat calmly as that of
       one who slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. I
       folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. The police
       were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee at my heart
       was too strong to be restrained. I burned to say if but one word, by
       way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my
       guiltlessness.

       “Gentlemen,” I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, “I delight
       to have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health, and a little
       more courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this--this is a very well
       constructed house.” [In the rabid desire to say something easily, I
       scarcely knew what I uttered at all.]--“I may say an _excellently_ well
       constructed house. These walls--are you going, gentlemen?--these walls
       are solidly put together;” and here, through the mere phrenzy of
       bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon
       that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the
       wife of my bosom.

       But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend! No
       sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence, than I was
       answered by a voice from within the tomb!--by a cry, at first muffled
       and broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into
       one long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman--a
       howl--a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as
       might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the
       dammed in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.

       Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to
       the opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs remained
       motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In the next, a dozen
       stout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell bodily. The corpse, already
       greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of
       the spectators. Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye
       of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder,
       and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled
       the monster up within the tomb!




       THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER

            Son coeur est un luth suspendu;
            Sitôt qu’on le touche il rèsonne..

                                    _  De Béranger_.

       DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the
       year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had
       been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of
       country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew
       on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how
       it was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of
       insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the
       feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic,
       sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest
       natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene
       before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the
       domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant eye-like windows--upon a
       few rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees--with an
       utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation
       more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the
       bitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil.
       There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemed
       dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture
       into aught of the sublime. What was it--I paused to think--what was it
       that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a
       mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that
       crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the
       unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there _are_
       combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus
       affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations
       beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different
       arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the
       picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its
       capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined
       my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in
       unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with a shudder
       even more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled and inverted images
       of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and
       eye-like windows.

       Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a
       sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of
       my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last
       meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of
       the country--a letter from him--which, in its wildly importunate nature,
       had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of
       nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mental
       disorder which oppressed him--and of an earnest desire to see me, as his
       best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by
       the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It
       was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said--it was the
       apparent _heart_ that went with his request--which allowed me no
       room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still
       considered a very singular summons.

       Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really
       knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and
       habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been
       noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament,
       displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and
       manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive
       charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps
       even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of
       musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the
       stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no
       period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay
       in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and
       very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered,
       while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of
       the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while
       speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long
       lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was this
       deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating
       transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which
       had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title
       of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the “House
       of Usher”--an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the
       peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.

       I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish
       experiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to deepen the
       first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness
       of the rapid increase of my superstition--for why should I not so term
       it?--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have
       long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a
       basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again
       uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there
       grew in my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I
       but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed
       me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that
       about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar
       to themselves and their immediate vicinity--an atmosphere which had
       no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the
       decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn--a pestilent and
       mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.

       Shaking off from my spirit what _must_ have been a dream, I scanned more
       narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed
       to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been
       great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine
       tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any
       extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and
       there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect
       adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual
       stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality
       of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected
       vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond
       this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little
       token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might
       have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the
       roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag
       direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.

       Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A
       servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of
       the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence,
       through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the _studio_
       of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know
       not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already
       spoken. While the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings,
       the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors,
       and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were
       but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my
       infancy--while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all
       this--I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which
       ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the
       physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled
       expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with
       trepidation and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered
       me into the presence of his master.

       The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows
       were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black
       oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams
       of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes,
       and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects
       around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles
       of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.
       Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse,
       comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments
       lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I
       felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and
       irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.

       Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at
       full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in
       it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality--of the constrained
       effort of the _ennuyé_ man of the world. A glance, however, at his
       countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for
       some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half
       of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered,
       in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that
       I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me
       with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face
       had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye
       large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and
       very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a
       delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar
       formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence,
       of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and
       tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions
       of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be
       forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character
       of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay
       so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor
       of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things
       startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to
       grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated
       rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect
       its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.

       In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence--an
       inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble
       and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy--an excessive
       nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been
       prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain
       boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical
       conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and
       sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the
       animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic
       concision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding
       enunciation--that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated
       guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the
       irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense
       excitement.

       It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest
       desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He
       entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his
       malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one
       for which he despaired to find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he
       immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed
       itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed
       them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and
       the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much
       from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone
       endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors
       of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint
       light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed
       instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.

       To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. “I shall
       perish,” said he, “I must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus,
       and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future,
       not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought
       of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this
       intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger,
       except in its absolute effect--in terror. In this unnerved--in this
       pitiable condition--I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive
       when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the
       grim phantasm, FEAR.”

       I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal
       hints, another singular feature of his mental condition. He was
       enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling
       which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured
       forth--in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed
       in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated--an influence which some
       peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had,
       by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit--an effect
       which the _physique_ of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn
       into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the
       _morale_ of his existence.

       He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the
       peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more
       natural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and long-continued
       illness--indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution--of a tenderly
       beloved sister--his sole companion for long years--his last and only
       relative on earth. “Her decease,” he said, with a bitterness which I can
       never forget, “would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last
       of the ancient race of the Ushers.” While he spoke, the lady Madeline
       (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the
       apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I
       regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread--and
       yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of
       stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a
       door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and
       eagerly the countenance of the brother--but he had buried his face
       in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary
       wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many
       passionate tears.

       The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her
       physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person,
       and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical
       character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne
       up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself
       finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival
       at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with
       inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer;
       and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus
       probably be the last I should obtain--that the lady, at least while
       living, would be seen by me no more.

       For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or
       myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to
       alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or
       I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking
       guitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more
       unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did
       I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which
       darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all
       objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation
       of gloom.

       I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus
       spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in
       any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies,
       or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An
       excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over
       all. His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among
       other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and
       amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the
       paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch
       by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly,
       because I shuddered knowing not why;--from these paintings (vivid as
       their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavor to educe more
       than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely
       written words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs,
       he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that
       mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least--in the circumstances then
       surrounding me--there arose out of the pure abstractions which the
       hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass, an intensity of
       intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation
       of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli.

       One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so
       rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although
       feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immensely
       long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and
       without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design
       served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding
       depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any
       portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of
       light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout,
       and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.

       I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which
       rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of
       certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow
       limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave
       birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances.
       But the fervid _facility_ of his _impromptus_ could not be so accounted
       for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the
       words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself
       with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental
       collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded
       as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial
       excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily
       remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as
       he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I
       fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness
       on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her
       throne. The verses, which were entitled “The Haunted Palace,” ran very
       nearly, if not accurately, thus:

                                I.
            In the greenest of our valleys,
                By good angels tenanted,
            Once a fair and stately palace--
                Radiant palace--reared its head.
            In the monarch Thought’s dominion--
                It stood there!
            Never seraph spread a pinion
                Over fabric half so fair.
                                II.
            Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
                On its roof did float and flow;
            (This--all this--was in the olden
                Time long ago)
            And every gentle air that dallied,
                In that sweet day,
            Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
                A winged odor went away.
                                III.
            Wanderers in that happy valley
                Through two luminous windows saw
            Spirits moving musically
                To a lute’s well-tunéd law,
            Round about a throne, where sitting
                (Porphyrogene!)
            In state his glory well befitting,
                The ruler of the realm was seen.
                                 IV.
            And all with pearl and ruby glowing
                Was the fair palace door,
            Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
                And sparkling evermore,
            A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty
                Was but to sing,
            In voices of surpassing beauty,
                The wit and wisdom of their king.
                                V.
            But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
                Assailed the monarch’s high estate;
            (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow
                Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)
            And, round about his home, the glory
                That blushed and bloomed
            Is but a dim-remembered story
                Of the old time entombed.
                                VI.
            And travellers now within that valley,
                Through the red-litten windows, see
            Vast forms that move fantastically
                To a discordant melody;
            While, like a rapid ghastly river,
                Through the pale door,
            A hideous throng rush out forever,
                And laugh--but smile no more.

       I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us into
       a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher’s
       which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men
       * have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which
       he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the
       sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the
       idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain
       conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express
       the full extent, or the earnest _abandon_ of his persuasion. The belief,
       however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray
       stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience
       had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of
       these stones--in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of
       the many _fungi_ which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which
       stood around--above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this
       arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn.
       Its evidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he
       said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain
       condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the
       walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet
       importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the
       destinies of his family, and which made _him_ what I now saw him--what
       he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.

       Landaff.--See “Chemical Essays,” vol v.

       Our books--the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of
       the mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be supposed, in
       strict keeping with this character of phantasm. We pored together over
       such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of
       Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage
       of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean
       D’Indaginé, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of
       Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite volume was
       a small octavo edition of the _Directorium Inquisitorium_, by the
       Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela,
       about the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over which Usher would sit
       dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal
       of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic--the manual of
       a forgotten church--the _Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae
       Maguntinae_.

       I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its
       probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having
       informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his
       intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its
       final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls
       of the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular
       proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The
       brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration
       of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain
       obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the
       remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will
       not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the
       person whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival at
       the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a
       harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.

       At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for
       the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone
       bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had
       been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive
       atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small,
       damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great
       depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my
       own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal
       times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a
       place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance,
       as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway
       through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The
       door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense
       weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its
       hinges.

       Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of
       horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin,
       and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between
       the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher,
       divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which
       I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that
       sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between
       them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for we could
       not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in
       the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly
       cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and
       the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is
       so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having
       secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely
       less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.

       And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change
       came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His
       ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or
       forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and
       objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible,
       a more ghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone
       out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a
       tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized
       his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly
       agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which
       he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged
       to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I
       beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the
       profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It was
       no wonder that his condition terrified--that it infected me. I felt
       creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of
       his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.

       It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the
       seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the
       donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came
       not near my couch--while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to
       reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavored to
       believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering
       influence of the gloomy furniture of the room--of the dark and tattered
       draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising
       tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily
       about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An
       irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there
       sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking
       this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows,
       and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber,
       harkened--I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted
       me--to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses
       of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an
       intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on
       my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the
       night), and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into
       which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.

       I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an
       adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as
       that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch,
       at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,
       cadaverously wan--but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in
       his eyes--an evidently restrained _hysteria_ in his whole demeanor. His
       air appalled me--but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had
       so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.

       “And you have not seen it?” he said abruptly, after having stared about
       him for some moments in silence--“you have not then seen it?--but, stay!
       you shall.” Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he
       hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.

       The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet.
       It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one
       wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently
       collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent
       alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of
       the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house)
       did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they
       flew careering from all points against each other, without passing
       away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did
       not prevent our perceiving this--yet we had no glimpse of the moon or
       stars--nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the
       under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all
       terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural
       light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation
       which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.

       “You must not--you shall not behold this!” said I, shudderingly, to
       Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat.
       “These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena
       not uncommon--or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in
       the rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement;--the air is
       chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favorite
       romances. I will read, and you shall listen;--and so we will pass away
       this terrible night together.”

       The antique volume which I had taken up was the “Mad Trist” of Sir
       Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher’s more in sad
       jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and
       unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty
       and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book
       immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement
       which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history
       of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness
       of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the
       wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened, or apparently
       harkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated
       myself upon the success of my design.

       I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred,
       the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission
       into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by
       force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:

       “And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now
       mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had
       drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth,
       was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his
       shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace
       outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the
       door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so
       cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and
       hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest.”

       At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused;
       for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited
       fancy had deceived me)--it appeared to me that, from some very remote
       portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might
       have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled
       and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which
       Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt,
       the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the
       rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled
       noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing,
       surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the
       story:

       “But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore
       enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but,
       in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, and
       of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a
       floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass
       with this legend enwritten--

            Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;
            Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;

       And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon,
       which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so
       horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to
       close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like
       whereof was never before heard.”

       Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild
       amazement--for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance,
       I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I
       found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh,
       protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound--the exact
       counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon’s
       unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.

       Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and
       most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations,
       in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained
       sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the
       sensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that
       he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange
       alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his
       demeanor. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought
       round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber;
       and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw
       that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had
       dropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the
       wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile.
       The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea--for he
       rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.
       Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir
       Launcelot, which thus proceeded:

       “And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the
       dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up
       of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of
       the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement
       of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth
       tarried not for his full coming, but feel down at his feet upon the
       silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.”

       No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a shield
       of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of
       silver--I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous,
       yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I leaped to
       my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I
       rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly
       before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony
       rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a
       strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his
       lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur,
       as if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length
       drank in the hideous import of his words.

       “Not hear it?--yes, I hear it, and _have_ heard it.
       Long--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard
       it--yet I dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!--I dared
       not--I _dared_ not speak! _We have put her living in the tomb!_ Said I
       not that my senses were acute? I _now_ tell you that I heard her first
       feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them--many,
       many days ago--yet I dared not--_I dared not speak!_ And
       now--to-night--Ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking of the hermit’s door,
       and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the shield!--say,
       rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of
       her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault!
       Oh whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying
       to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair?
       Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?
       Madman!”--here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his
       syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul--“_Madman!
       I tell you that she now stands without the door!_”

       As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found
       the potency of a spell--the huge antique pannels to which the speaker
       pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony
       jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust--but then without those doors
       there _did_ stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline
       of Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some
       bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment
       she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold--then,
       with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her
       brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the
       floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.

       From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The storm
       was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old
       causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned
       to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house
       and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full,
       setting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly through that once
       barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as extending
       from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. While
       I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened--there came a fierce breath of
       the whirlwind--the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my
       sight--my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder--there
       was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand
       waters--and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and
       silently over the fragments of the “_House of Usher_.”




       SILENCE--A FABLE

            ALCMAN. The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags and
            caves are silent.

       “LISTEN to me,” said the Demon as he placed his hand upon my head. “The
       region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders of
       the river Zaire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.

       “The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flow
       not onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the
       red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many
       miles on either side of the river’s oozy bed is a pale desert of
       gigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude,
       and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to
       and fro their everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur which
       cometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water. And
       they sigh one unto the other.

       “But there is a boundary to their realm--the boundary of the dark,
       horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the
       low underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughout
       the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and
       thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits,
       one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots strange poisonous
       flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling
       and loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever, until they
       roll, a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no
       wind throughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire there
       is neither quiet nor silence.

       “It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but, having
       fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall and the
       rain fell upon my head--and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the
       solemnity of their desolation.

       “And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was
       crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood
       by the shore of the river, and was lighted by the light of the moon. And
       the rock was gray, and ghastly, and tall,--and the rock was gray. Upon
       its front were characters engraven in the stone; and I walked through
       the morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I
       might read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decypher them.
       And I was going back into the morass, when the moon shone with a
       fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock, and upon the
       characters;--and the characters were DESOLATION.

       “And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the
       rock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the
       actions of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and was
       wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And
       the outlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were the
       features of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and
       of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his
       face. And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care;
       and, in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and
       weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.

       “And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and
       looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet
       shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the
       rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close within
       shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the
       man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the
       rock.

       “And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon
       the dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the
       pale legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs of
       the water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And I
       lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the
       man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned and he sat upon the
       rock.

       “Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in
       among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami
       which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And the
       hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot
       of the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay
       close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man
       trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.

       “Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful
       tempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had been no wind.
       And the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest--and the
       rain beat upon the head of the man--and the floods of the river came
       down--and the river was tormented into foam--and the water-lilies
       shrieked within their beds--and the forest crumbled before the wind--and
       the thunder rolled--and the lightning fell--and the rock rocked to its
       foundation. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of
       the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned and
       he sat upon the rock.

       “Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river,
       and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the
       thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed,
       and were still. And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to
       heaven--and the thunder died away--and the lightning did not flash--and
       the clouds hung motionless--and the waters sunk to their level and
       remained--and the trees ceased to rock--and the water-lilies sighed no
       more--and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow
       of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the
       characters of the rock, and they were changed;--and the characters were
       SILENCE.

       “And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance
       was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand,
       and stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voice
       throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock
       were SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled
       afar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more.”

       Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi--in the iron-bound,
       melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious histories
       of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty sea--and of the Genii
       that over-ruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There was
       much lore too in the sayings which were said by the Sybils; and holy,
       holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around
       Dodona--but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon told me as
       he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most
       wonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell
       back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh
       with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynx
       which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at
       the feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.




       THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH.

       THE “Red Death” had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever
       been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal--the
       redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden
       dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The
       scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim,
       were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy
       of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of
       the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.

       But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his
       dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand
       hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of
       his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his
       castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the
       creation of the prince’s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and
       lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers,
       having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.
       They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden
       impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply
       provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to
       contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime
       it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the
       appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori,
       there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty,
       there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the “Red
       Death.”

       It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion,
       and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince
       Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most
       unusual magnificence.

       It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the
       rooms in which it was held. There were seven--an imperial suite. In many
       palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the
       folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that
       the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was
       very different; as might have been expected from the duke’s love of the
       bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision
       embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at
       every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the
       right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic
       window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of
       the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in
       accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber
       into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for
       example, in blue--and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber
       was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were
       purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The
       fourth was furnished and lighted with orange--the fifth with white--the
       sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black
       velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls,
       falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But
       in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with
       the decorations. The panes here were scarlet--a deep blood color. Now in
       no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid
       the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or
       depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from
       lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors
       that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy
       tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the
       tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced
       a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or
       black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark
       hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and
       produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered,
       that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its
       precincts at all.

       It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western
       wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a
       dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit
       of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the
       brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and
       exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at
       each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained
       to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound;
       and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a
       brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the
       clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the
       more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in
       confused reverie or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased,
       a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at
       each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made
       whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock
       should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of
       sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of
       the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock,
       and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as
       before.

       But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.
       The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors and
       effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold
       and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are
       some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not.
       It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was
       not.

       He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the seven
       chambers, upon occasion of this great fete; and it was his own guiding
       taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they
       were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and
       phantasm--much of what has been since seen in “Hernani.” There were
       arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were
       delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There was much of the
       beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the
       terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.
       To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of
       dreams. And these--the dreams--writhed in and about, taking hue from the
       rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo
       of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in
       the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is
       silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they
       stand. But the echoes of the chime die away--they have endured but an
       instant--and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they
       depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe
       to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted
       windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to the
       chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of
       the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a
       ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the
       sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet,
       there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly
       emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more
       remote gaieties of the other apartments.

       But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat
       feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at
       length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then
       the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers
       were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.
       But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the
       clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with
       more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who
       revelled. And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last
       echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many
       individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the
       presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no
       single individual before. And the rumor of this new presence having
       spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the
       whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and
       surprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.

       In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be
       supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.
       In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but
       the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds
       of even the prince’s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts
       of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with
       the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are
       matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed
       now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger
       neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and
       shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The
       mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the
       countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have
       had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been
       endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer
       had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was
       dabbled in blood--and his broad brow, with all the features of the face,
       was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.

       When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which
       with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role,
       stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in
       the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste;
       but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.

       “Who dares?” he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near
       him--“who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and
       unmask him--that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the
       battlements!”

       It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero
       as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly
       and clearly--for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had
       become hushed at the waving of his hand.

       It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale
       courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing
       movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the
       moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step,
       made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe
       with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole
       party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that,
       unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince’s person; and, while
       the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of
       the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the
       same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the
       first, through the blue chamber to the purple--through the purple to
       the green--through the green to the orange--through this again to the
       white--and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been
       made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero,
       maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed
       hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account
       of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn
       dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or
       four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the
       extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his
       pursuer. There was a sharp cry--and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the
       sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death
       the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair,
       a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black
       apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and
       motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable
       horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they
       handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.

       And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come
       like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the
       blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing
       posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with
       that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And
       Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.




       THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.

       THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but
       when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the
       nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to
       a threat. _At length_ I would be avenged; this was a point definitively
       settled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved,
       precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with
       impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its
       redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make
       himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.

       It must be understood, that neither by word nor deed had I given
       Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to
       smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was at
       the thought of his immolation.

       He had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was
       a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his
       connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.
       For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and
       opportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian
       _millionaires_. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen,
       was a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this
       respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skilful in the
       Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.

       It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the
       carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with
       excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He
       had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted
       by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I
       thought I should never have done wringing his hand.

       I said to him--“My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably
       well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes
       for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.”

       “How?” said he. “Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of
       the carnival!”

       “I have my doubts,” I replied; “and I was silly enough to pay the full
       Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to
       be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.”

       “Amontillado!”

       “I have my doubts.”

       “Amontillado!”

       “And I must satisfy them.”

       “Amontillado!”

       “As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a
       critical turn, it is he. He will tell me--”

       “Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.”

       “And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your
       own.”

       “Come, let us go.”

       “Whither?”

       “To your vaults.”

       “My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you
       have an engagement. Luchesi--”

       “I have no engagement;--come.”

       “My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which
       I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are
       encrusted with nitre.”

       “Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You
       have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry
       from Amontillado.”

       Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask
       of black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my person, I
       suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.

       There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in
       honor of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the
       morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.
       These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate
       disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.

       I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,
       bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into
       the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him
       to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the
       descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the
       Montresors.

       The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled
       as he strode.

       “The pipe,” said he.

       “It is farther on,” said I; “but observe the white web-work which gleams
       from these cavern walls.”

       He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that
       distilled the rheum of intoxication.

       “Nitre?” he asked, at length.

       “Nitre,” I replied. “How long have you had that cough?”

       “Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh!
       ugh! ugh!”

       My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.

       “It is nothing,” he said, at last.

       “Come,” I said, with decision, “we will go back; your health is
       precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as
       once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will
       go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is
       Luchesi--”

       “Enough,” he said; “the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I
       shall not die of a cough.”

       “True--true,” I replied; “and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming
       you unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of
       this Medoc will defend us from the damps.”

       Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of
       its fellows that lay upon the mould.

       “Drink,” I said, presenting him the wine.

       He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me
       familiarly, while his bells jingled.

       “I drink,” he said, “to the buried that repose around us.”

       “And I to your long life.”

       He again took my arm, and we proceeded.

       “These vaults,” he said, “are extensive.”

       “The Montresors,” I replied, “were a great and numerous family.”

       “I forget your arms.”

       “A huge human foot d’or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent
       rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.”

       “And the motto?”

       “_Nemo me impune lacessit_.”

       “Good!” he said.

       The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew
       warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with
       casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the
       catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato
       by an arm above the elbow.

       “The nitre!” I said: “see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the
       vaults. We are below the river’s bed. The drops of moisture trickle
       among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough--”

       “It is nothing,” he said; “let us go on. But first, another draught of
       the Medoc.”

       I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grâve. He emptied it at a breath.
       His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle
       upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.

       I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.

       “You do not comprehend?” he said.

       “Not I,” I replied.

       “Then you are not of the brotherhood.”

       “How?”

       “You are not of the masons.”

       “Yes, yes,” I said, “yes, yes.”

       “You? Impossible! A mason?”

       “A mason,” I replied.

       “A sign,” he said.

       “It is this,” I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of
       my _roquelaire_.

       “You jest,” he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. “But let us proceed to
       the Amontillado.”

       “Be it so,” I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again
       offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route
       in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches,
       descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in
       which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than
       flame.

       At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less
       spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the
       vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three
       sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From
       the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon
       the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall
       thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still
       interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height
       six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use
       in itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal
       supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their
       circumscribing walls of solid granite.

       It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to
       pry into the depths of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did
       not enable us to see.

       “Proceed,” I said; “herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi--”

       “He is an ignoramus,” interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily
       forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had
       reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested
       by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered
       him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from
       each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended
       a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his
       waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too
       much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the
       recess.

       “Pass your hand,” I said, “over the wall; you cannot help feeling the
       nitre. Indeed it is _very_ damp. Once more let me _implore_ you to
       return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render
       you all the little attentions in my power.”

       “The Amontillado!” ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his
       astonishment.

       “True,” I replied; “the Amontillado.”

       As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I
       have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of
       building stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my
       trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.

       I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discovered
       that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The
       earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth
       of the recess. It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then a
       long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and
       the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The
       noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to
       it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon the
       bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and
       finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh
       tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again
       paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few
       feeble rays upon the figure within.

       A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the
       throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a
       brief moment I hesitated--I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to
       grope with it about the recess: but the thought of an instant reassured
       me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt
       satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him
       who clamored. I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume and in
       strength. I did this, and the clamorer grew still.

       It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed
       the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion
       of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to
       be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it
       partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the
       niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded
       by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the
       noble Fortunato. The voice said--

       “Ha! ha! ha!--he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. We
       will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! he!--over
       our wine--he! he! he!”

       “The Amontillado!” I said.

       “He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting
       late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato
       and the rest? Let us be gone.”

       “Yes,” I said, “let us be gone.”

       “_For the love of God, Montressor!_”

       “Yes,” I said, “for the love of God!”

       But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I
       called aloud--

       “Fortunato!”

       No answer. I called again--

       “Fortunato!”

       No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let
       it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells.
       My heart grew sick--on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I
       hastened to make an end of my labor. I forced the last stone into its
       position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the
       old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed
       them. _In pace requiescat!_




       THE IMP OF THE PERVERSE

       IN THE consideration of the faculties and impulses--of the prima mobilia
       of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for a
       propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive,
       irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists
       who have preceded them. In the pure arrogance of the reason, we have
       all overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses,
       solely through want of belief--of faith;--whether it be faith in
       Revelation, or faith in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurred
       to us, simply because of its supererogation. We saw no need of the
       impulse--for the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We
       could not understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had
       the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;--we could not
       have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects
       of humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that
       phrenology and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have been
       concocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man, rather than the
       understanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs--to
       dictate purposes to God. Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the
       intentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his innumerable
       systems of mind. In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first
       determined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that
       man should eat. We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness,
       and this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man, will-I
       nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled it to be God’s will that
       man should continue his species, we discovered an organ of amativeness,
       forthwith. And so with combativeness, with ideality, with causality,
       with constructiveness,--so, in short, with every organ, whether
       representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty of the pure
       intellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action,
       the Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole,
       have but followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors:
       deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of
       man, and upon the ground of the objects of his Creator.

       It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if
       classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally
       did, and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of
       what we took it for granted the Deity intended him to do. If we cannot
       comprehend God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable
       thoughts, that call the works into being? If we cannot understand him in
       his objective creatures, how then in his substantive moods and phases of
       creation?

       Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an
       innate and primitive principle of human action, a paradoxical something,
       which we may call perverseness, for want of a more characteristic term.
       In the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a mobile without motive, a motive
       not motivirt. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible
       object; or, if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we
       may so far modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings
       we act, for the reason that we should not. In theory, no reason can be
       more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With certain
       minds, under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely irresistible. I
       am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrong
       or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels
       us, and alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming
       tendency to do wrong for the wrong’s sake, admit of analysis, or
       resolution into ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitive
       impulse-elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we persist in
       acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but a
       modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness
       of phrenology. But a glance will show the fallacy of this idea. The
       phrenological combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of
       self-defence. It is our safeguard against injury. Its principle regards
       our well-being; and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously
       with its development. It follows, that the desire to be well must
       be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a
       modification of combativeness, but in the case of that something which I
       term perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a
       strongly antagonistical sentiment exists.

       An appeal to one’s own heart is, after all, the best reply to the
       sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly
       questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness
       of the propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than
       distinctive. There lives no man who at some period has not been
       tormented, for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by
       circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every
       intention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the most
       laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his
       tongue, it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving
       it flow; he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses;
       yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and
       parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough.
       The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to
       an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the deep regret and
       mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is
       indulged.

       We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that
       it will be ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life
       calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. We glow, we are
       consumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation of
       whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire. It must, it shall be
       undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow, and why?
       There is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with
       no comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more
       impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety
       arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable,
       craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the moments fly.
       The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble with the violence of
       the conflict within us,--of the definite with the indefinite--of the
       substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus
       far, it is the shadow which prevails,--we struggle in vain. The clock
       strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it is
       the chanticleer--note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. It
       flies--it disappears--we are free. The old energy returns. We will labor
       now. Alas, it is too late!

       We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss--we
       grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger.
       Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and
       horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling. By gradations,
       still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor
       from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights.
       But out of this our cloud upon the precipice’s edge, there grows into
       palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon
       of a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one
       which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the
       delight of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our
       sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a
       height. And this fall--this rushing annihilation--for the very reason
       that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most
       ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever
       presented themselves to our imagination--for this very cause do we now
       the most vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us
       from the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it. There
       is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who,
       shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a Plunge. To
       indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably
       lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I
       say, that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we
       fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss,
       we plunge, and are destroyed.

       Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting
       solely from the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate them because we
       feel that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible
       principle; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct
       instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to operate
       in furtherance of good.

       I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question,
       that I may explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to you
       something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my
       wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned.
       Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have misunderstood me
       altogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me mad. As it is, you will
       easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp
       of the Perverse.

       It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more
       thorough deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the
       means of the murder. I rejected a thousand schemes, because their
       accomplishment involved a chance of detection. At length, in reading
       some French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness that
       occurred to Madame Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentally
       poisoned. The idea struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim’s habit
       of reading in bed. I knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and
       ill-ventilated. But I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need
       not describe the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room
       candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I there
       found. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and the
       Coroner’s verdict was--“Death by the visitation of God.”

       Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The idea
       of detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fatal
       taper I had myself carefully disposed. I had left no shadow of a clew
       by which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the
       crime. It is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose
       in my bosom as I reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long
       period of time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded
       me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from
       my sin. But there arrived at length an epoch, from which the pleasurable
       feeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations, into a haunting and
       harassing thought. It harassed because it haunted. I could scarcely get
       rid of it for an instant. It is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed
       with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen
       of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera.
       Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or
       the opera air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetually
       catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low
       undertone, the phrase, “I am safe.”

       One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the
       act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of
       petulance, I remodelled them thus; “I am safe--I am safe--yes--if I be
       not fool enough to make open confession!”

       No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill creep to
       my heart. I had had some experience in these fits of perversity, (whose
       nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well
       that in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And now
       my own casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to
       confess the murder of which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the
       very ghost of him whom I had murdered--and beckoned me on to death.

       At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul.
       I walked vigorously--faster--still faster--at length I ran. I felt
       a maddening desire to shriek aloud. Every succeeding wave of thought
       overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understood
       that to think, in my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened my
       pace. I bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares. At
       length, the populace took the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then the
       consummation of my fate. Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have
       done it, but a rough voice resounded in my ears--a rougher grasp seized
       me by the shoulder. I turned--I gasped for breath. For a moment I
       experienced all the pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf,
       and giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his
       broad palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from my
       soul.

       They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with marked
       emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before
       concluding the brief, but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the
       hangman and to hell.

       Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial
       conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.

       But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these chains, and am here!
       To-morrow I shall be fetterless!--but where?




       THE ISLAND OF THE FAY

            Nullus enim locus sine genio est.--_Servius_.

       “LA MUSIQUE,” says Marmontel, in those “Contes Moraux” (*1) which in all
       our translations, we have insisted upon calling “Moral Tales,” as if
       in mockery of their spirit--“la musique est le seul des talents qui
       jouissent de lui-meme; tous les autres veulent des temoins.” He here
       confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity
       for creating them. No more than any other talent, is that for music
       susceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to
       appreciate its exercise. And it is only in common with other talents
       that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The
       idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or
       has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point, is,
       doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of music is
       the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone. The
       proposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by those who love
       the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual uses. But there is one
       pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only
       one--which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment
       of seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of
       natural scenery. In truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of
       God upon earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me, at least, the
       presence--not of human life only, but of life in any other form than
       that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless--is
       a stain upon the landscape--is at war with the genius of the scene. I
       love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, and
       the waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy
       slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all,--I
       love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast
       animate and sentient whole--a whole whose form (that of the sphere)
       is the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among
       associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate
       sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of
       a God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in
       immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance
       of the animalculae which infest the brain--a being which we, in
       consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same
       manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.

       Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on
       every hand--notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the
       priesthood--that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important
       consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars
       move are those best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of
       the greatest possible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies are
       accurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatest
       possible amount of matter;--while the surfaces themselves are
       so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be
       accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged. Nor is it any
       argument against bulk being an object with God, that space itself is
       infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it. And
       since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a
       principle--indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the leading principle
       in the operations of Deity,--it is scarcely logical to imagine it
       confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, and not
       extending to those of the august. As we find cycle within cycle without
       end,--yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the
       God-head, may we not analogically suppose in the same manner, life
       within life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit
       Divine? In short, we are madly erring, through self-esteem, in believing
       man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment
       in the universe than that vast “clod of the valley” which he tills and
       contemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than
       that he does not behold it in operation. (*2)

       These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations
       among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a
       tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic. My
       wanderings amid such scenes have been many, and far-searching, and often
       solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim,
       deep valley, or gazed into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake,
       has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed
       and gazed alone. What flippant Frenchman was it who said in allusion
       to the well-known work of Zimmerman, that, “la solitude est une belle
       chose; mais il faut quelqu’un pour vous dire que la solitude est une
       belle chose?” The epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the necessity is a
       thing that does not exist.

       It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region
       of mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarn
       writhing or sleeping within all--that I chanced upon a certain rivulet
       and island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw
       myself upon the turf, beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,
       that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only
       should I look upon it--such was the character of phantasm which it wore.

       On all sides--save to the west, where the sun was about sinking--arose
       the verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply
       in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have
       no exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of
       the trees to the east--while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to
       me as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly
       and continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall
       from the sunset fountains of the sky.

       About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one
       small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the
       stream.

       So blended bank and shadow there

       That each seemed pendulous in air--so mirror-like was the glassy water,
       that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the
       emerald turf its crystal dominion began.

       My position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and
       western extremities of the islet; and I observed a singularly-marked
       difference in their aspects. The latter was all one radiant harem of
       garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant
       sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short,
       springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe,
       mirthful, erect--bright, slender, and graceful,--of eastern figure and
       foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed a
       deep sense of life and joy about all; and although no airs blew from out
       the heavens, yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to
       and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for
       tulips with wings. (*4)

       The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.
       A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things. The
       trees were dark in color, and mournful in form and attitude, wreathing
       themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of
       mortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the deep tint of the
       cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and
       thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow,
       and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not; although
       over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shade
       of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself
       therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. I fancied
       that each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itself
       sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed by
       the stream; while other shadows issued momently from the trees, taking
       the place of their predecessors thus entombed.

       This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it, and I
       lost myself forthwith in revery. “If ever island were enchanted,” said
       I to myself, “this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who
       remain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?--or do
       they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In dying,
       do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God, little by
       little, their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,
       exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree is to
       the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys
       upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?”

       As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to
       rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing
       upon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of the
       sycamore-flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a
       quick imagination might have converted into any thing it pleased, while
       I thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays
       about whom I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness
       from out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect
       in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an
       oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude
       seemed indicative of joy--but sorrow deformed it as she passed within
       the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and
       re-entered the region of light. “The revolution which has just been made
       by the Fay,” continued I, musingly, “is the cycle of the brief year of
       her life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. She
       is a year nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see that, as she came
       into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the
       dark water, making its blackness more black.”

       And again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of the
       latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.
       She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened
       momently) and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and
       became absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made the
       circuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and
       at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,
       while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each
       passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became
       whelmed in a shadow more black. But at length when the sun had
       utterly departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went
       disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and
       that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over all
       things and I beheld her magical figure no more.




       THE ASSIGNATION

            Stay for me there!   I will not fail.
            To meet thee in that hollow vale.

            [_Exequy on the death of his wife, by Henry King,
             Bishop of Chichester_.]

       ILL-FATED and mysterious man!--bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own
       imagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own youth! Again in fancy
       I behold thee! Once more thy form hath risen before me!--not--oh not
       as thou art--in the cold valley and shadow--but as thou _shouldst
       be_--squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of
       dim visions, thine own Venice--which is a star-beloved Elysium of the
       sea, and the wide windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a
       deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes! I
       repeat it--as thou _shouldst be_. There are surely other worlds
       than this--other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude--other
       speculations than the speculations of the sophist. Who then shall call
       thy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary hours, or
       denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life, which were but the
       overflowings of thine everlasting energies?

       It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the _Ponte di
       Sospiri_, that I met for the third or fourth time the person of whom
       I speak. It is with a confused recollection that I bring to mind
       the circumstances of that meeting. Yet I remember--ah! how should I
       forget?--the deep midnight, the Bridge of Sighs, the beauty of woman,
       and the Genius of Romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal.

       It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza had
       sounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The square of the
       Campanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights in the old Ducal
       Palace were dying fast away. I was returning home from the Piazetta, by
       way of the Grand Canal. But as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth
       of the canal San Marco, a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly
       upon the night, in one wild, hysterical, and long continued shriek.
       Startled at the sound, I sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier,
       letting slip his single oar, lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a
       chance of recovery, and we were consequently left to the guidance of the
       current which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel.
       Like some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were slowly drifting down
       towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the
       windows, and down the staircases of the Ducal Palace, turned all at once
       that deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day.

       A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen from an
       upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal. The
       quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim; and, although my own
       gondola was the only one in sight, many a stout swimmer, already in the
       stream, was seeking in vain upon the surface, the treasure which was
       to be found, alas! only within the abyss. Upon the broad black marble
       flagstones at the entrance of the palace, and a few steps above the
       water, stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since
       forgotten. It was the Marchesa Aphrodite--the adoration of all
       Venice--the gayest of the gay--the most lovely where all were
       beautiful--but still the young wife of the old and intriguing Mentoni,
       and the mother of that fair child, her first and only one, who now, deep
       beneath the murky water, was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her
       sweet caresses, and exhausting its little life in struggles to call upon
       her name.

       She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in the
       black mirror of marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more than
       half loosened for the night from its ball-room array, clustered, amid
       a shower of diamonds, round and round her classical head, in curls like
       those of the young hyacinth. A snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed
       to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form; but the mid-summer
       and midnight air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the
       statue-like form itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of very
       vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe.
       Yet--strange to say!--her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards
       upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried--but riveted in a
       widely different direction! The prison of the Old Republic is, I think,
       the stateliest building in all Venice--but how could that lady gaze so
       fixedly upon it, when beneath her lay stifling her only child? Yon dark,
       gloomy niche, too, yawns right opposite her chamber window--what,
       then, _could_ there be in its shadows--in its architecture--in its
       ivy-wreathed and solemn cornices--that the Marchesa di Mentoni had not
       wondered at a thousand times before? Nonsense!--Who does not remember
       that, at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror,
       multiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable far-off
       places, the woe which is close at hand?

       Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the water-gate,
       stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of Mentoni himself. He was
       occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar, and seemed _ennuye_ to the
       very death, as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his
       child. Stupified and aghast, I had myself no power to move from the
       upright position I had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must
       have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous
       appearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I floated down
       among them in that funereal gondola.

       All efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the search
       were relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy sorrow. There
       seemed but little hope for the child; (how much less than for the
       mother!) but now, from the interior of that dark niche which has been
       already mentioned as forming a part of the Old Republican prison, and
       as fronting the lattice of the Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak,
       stepped out within reach of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the
       verge of the giddy descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in an
       instant afterwards, he stood with the still living and breathing
       child within his grasp, upon the marble flagstones by the side of the
       Marchesa, his cloak, heavy with the drenching water, became unfastened,
       and, falling in folds about his feet, discovered to the wonder-stricken
       spectators the graceful person of a very young man, with the sound of
       whose name the greater part of Europe was then ringing.

       No word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now receive
       her child--she will press it to her heart--she will cling to its little
       form, and smother it with her caresses. Alas! _another’s_ arms have
       taken it from the stranger--_another’s_ arms have taken it away, and
       borne it afar off, unnoticed, into the palace! And the Marchesa! Her
       lip--her beautiful lip trembles: tears are gathering in her eyes--those
       eyes which, like Pliny’s acanthus, are “soft and almost liquid.” Yes!
       tears are gathering in those eyes--and see! the entire woman thrills
       throughout the soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallor
       of the marble countenance, the swelling of the marble bosom, the very
       purity of the marble feet, we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide
       of ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate
       frame, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich silver lilies in the
       grass.

       Why _should_ that lady blush! To this demand there is no answer--except
       that, having left, in the eager haste and terror of a mother’s heart,
       the privacy of her own _boudoir_, she has neglected to enthral her tiny
       feet in their slippers, and utterly forgotten to throw over her Venetian
       shoulders that drapery which is their due. What other possible reason
       could there have been for her so blushing?--for the glance of those wild
       appealing eyes? for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom?--for the
       convulsive pressure of that trembling hand?--that hand which fell,
       as Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, upon the hand of the
       stranger. What reason could there have been for the low--the singularly
       low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly in
       bidding him adieu? “Thou hast conquered,” she said, or the murmurs of
       the water deceived me; “thou hast conquered--one hour after sunrise--we
       shall meet--so let it be!”

       * * * * *

       The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the palace,
       and the stranger, whom I now recognized, stood alone upon the flags. He
       shook with inconceivable agitation, and his eye glanced around in search
       of a gondola. I could not do less than offer him the service of my own;
       and he accepted the civility. Having obtained an oar at the water-gate,
       we proceeded together to his residence, while he rapidly recovered his
       self-possession, and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of
       great apparent cordiality.

       There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being minute. The
       person of the stranger--let me call him by this title, who to all the
       world was still a stranger--the person of the stranger is one of these
       subjects. In height he might have been below rather than above the
       medium size: although there were moments of intense passion when his
       frame actually _expanded_ and belied the assertion. The light, almost
       slender symmetry of his figure, promised more of that ready activity
       which he evinced at the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strength
       which he has been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions of
       more dangerous emergency. With the mouth and chin of a deity--singular,
       wild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense
       and brilliant jet--and a profusion of curling, black hair, from which
       a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and
       ivory--his were features than which I have seen none more classically
       regular, except, perhaps, the marble ones of the Emperor Commodus. Yet
       his countenance was, nevertheless, one of those which all men have seen
       at some period of their lives, and have never afterwards seen again. It
       had no peculiar--it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened
       upon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten--but
       forgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind.
       Not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any time, to
       throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face--but that
       the mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of the passion, when the
       passion had departed.

       Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me, in
       what I thought an urgent manner, to call upon him _very_ early the
       next morning. Shortly after sunrise, I found myself accordingly at his
       Palazzo, one of those huge structures of gloomy, yet fantastic pomp,
       which tower above the waters of the Grand Canal in the vicinity of the
       Rialto. I was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics, into an
       apartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door
       with an actual glare, making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.

       I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken of his
       possessions in terms which I had even ventured to call terms of
       ridiculous exaggeration. But as I gazed about me, I could not bring
       myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in Europe could have
       supplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed around.

       Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was still
       brilliantly lighted up. I judge from this circumstance, as well as from
       an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend, that he had
       not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding night. In the
       architecture and embellishments of the chamber, the evident design
       had been to dazzle and astound. Little attention had been paid to the
       _decora_ of what is technically called _keeping_, or to the proprieties
       of nationality. The eye wandered from object to object, and rested upon
       none--neither the _grotesques_ of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures
       of the best Italian days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt. Rich
       draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low,
       melancholy music, whose origin was not to be discovered. The senses were
       oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes, reeking up from strange
       convolute censers, together with multitudinous flaring and flickering
       tongues of emerald and violet fire. The rays of the newly risen sun
       poured in upon the whole, through windows, formed each of a single pane
       of crimson-tinted glass. Glancing to and fro, in a thousand reflections,
       from curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten
       silver, the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with the
       artificial light, and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of
       rich, liquid-looking cloth of Chili gold.

       “Ha! ha! ha!--ha! ha! ha!”--laughed the proprietor, motioning me to
       a seat as I entered the room, and throwing himself back at full-length
       upon an ottoman. “I see,” said he, perceiving that I could not
       immediately reconcile myself to the _bienseance_ of so singular a
       welcome--“I see you are astonished at my apartment--at my statues--my
       pictures--my originality of conception in architecture and upholstery!
       absolutely drunk, eh, with my magnificence? But pardon me, my dear
       sir, (here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality,)
       pardon me for my uncharitable laughter. You appeared so _utterly_
       astonished. Besides, some things are so completely ludicrous, that a man
       _must_ laugh or die. To die laughing, must be the most glorious of
       all glorious deaths! Sir Thomas More--a very fine man was Sir Thomas
       More--Sir Thomas More died laughing, you remember. Also in the
       _Absurdities_ of Ravisius Textor, there is a long list of characters who
       came to the same magnificent end. Do you know, however,” continued he
       musingly, “that at Sparta (which is now Palæ; ochori,) at Sparta, I say,
       to the west of the citadel, among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, is
       a kind of _socle_, upon which are still legible the letters _AAEM_. They
       are undoubtedly part of _PEAAEMA_. Now, at Sparta were a thousand temples
       and shrines to a thousand different divinities. How exceedingly strange
       that the altar of Laughter should have survived all the others! But in
       the present instance,” he resumed, with a singular alteration of voice
       and manner, “I have no right to be merry at your expense. You might well
       have been amazed. Europe cannot produce anything so fine as this, my
       little regal cabinet. My other apartments are by no means of the same
       order--mere _ultras_ of fashionable insipidity. This is better than
       fashion--is it not? Yet this has but to be seen to become the rage--that
       is, with those who could afford it at the cost of their entire
       patrimony. I have guarded, however, against any such profanation.
       With one exception, you are the only human being besides myself and my
       _valet_, who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperial
       precincts, since they have been bedizzened as you see!”

       I bowed in acknowledgment--for the overpowering sense of splendor and
       perfume, and music, together with the unexpected eccentricity of
       his address and manner, prevented me from expressing, in words, my
       appreciation of what I might have construed into a compliment.

       “Here,” he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around
       the apartment, “here are paintings from the Greeks to Cimabue, and from
       Cimabue to the present hour. Many are chosen, as you see, with little
       deference to the opinions of Virtu. They are all, however, fitting
       tapestry for a chamber such as this. Here, too, are some _chefs
       d’oeuvre_ of the unknown great; and here, unfinished designs by men,
       celebrated in their day, whose very names the perspicacity of the
       academies has left to silence and to me. What think you,” said he,
       turning abruptly as he spoke--“what think you of this Madonna della
       Pieta?”

       “It is Guido’s own!” I said, with all the enthusiasm of my nature, for I
       had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness. “It is Guido’s
       own!--how _could_ you have obtained it?--she is undoubtedly in painting
       what the Venus is in sculpture.”

       “Ha!” said he thoughtfully, “the Venus--the beautiful Venus?--the Venus
       of the Medici?--she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair? Part of
       the left arm (here his voice dropped so as to be heard with difficulty,)
       and all the right, are restorations; and in the coquetry of that right
       arm lies, I think, the quintessence of all affectation. Give _me_ the
       Canova! The Apollo, too, is a copy--there can be no doubt of it--blind
       fool that I am, who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the Apollo!
       I cannot help--pity me!--I cannot help preferring the Antinous. Was it
       not Socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of
       marble? Then Michael Angelo was by no means original in his couplet--

            ‘Non ha l’ottimo artista alcun concetto
            Che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.’”

       It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of the true
       gentleman, we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the
       vulgar, without being at once precisely able to determine in what such
       difference consists. Allowing the remark to have applied in its full
       force to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance, I felt it, on that
       eventful morning, still more fully applicable to his moral temperament
       and character. Nor can I better define that peculiarity of spirit which
       seemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings,
       than by calling it a _habit_ of intense and continual thought,
       pervading even his most trivial actions--intruding upon his moments
       of dalliance--and interweaving itself with his very flashes of
       merriment--like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning
       masks in the cornices around the temples of Persepolis.

       I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the mingled
       tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon
       matters of little importance, a certain air of trepidation--a degree of
       nervous _unction_ in action and in speech--an unquiet excitability of
       manner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable, and upon some
       occasions even filled me with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in the
       middle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten,
       he seemed to be listening in the deepest attention, as if either in
       momentary expectation of a visiter, or to sounds which must have had
       existence in his imagination alone.

       It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction,
       that, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar Politian’s
       beautiful tragedy “The Orfeo,” (the first native Italian tragedy,)
       which lay near me upon an ottoman, I discovered a passage underlined in
       pencil. It was a passage towards the end of the third act--a passage of
       the most heart-stirring excitement--a passage which, although tainted
       with impurity, no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion--no
       woman without a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh tears; and,
       upon the opposite interleaf, were the following English lines,
       written in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my
       acquaintance, that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his own:--

            Thou wast that all to me, love,
            For which my soul did pine--
            A green isle in the sea, love,
            A fountain and a shrine,
            All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers;
            And all the flowers were mine.
            Ah, dream too bright to last!
            Ah, starry Hope, that didst arise
            But to be overcast!
            A voice from out the Future cries,
            “Onward!”--but o’er the Past
            (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies,
            Mute--motionless--aghast!
            For alas!  alas!  with me
            The light of life is o’er.
            “No more--no more--no more,”
             (Such language holds the solemn sea
            To the sands upon the shore,)
            Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
            Or the stricken eagle soar!
            Now all my hours are trances;
            And all my nightly dreams
            Are where the dark eye glances,
            And where thy footstep gleams,
            In what ethereal dances,
            By what Italian streams.
            Alas!  for that accursed time
            They bore thee o’er the billow,
            From Love to titled age and crime,
            And an unholy pillow!--
            From me, and from our misty clime,
            Where weeps the silver willow!

       That these lines were written in English--a language with which I had
       not believed their author acquainted--afforded me little matter for
       surprise. I was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements, and of
       the singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation, to
       be astonished at any similar discovery; but the place of date, I must
       confess, occasioned me no little amazement. It had been originally
       written _London_, and afterwards carefully overscored--not, however, so
       effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye. I say, this
       occasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a former
       conversation with a friend, I particularly inquired if he had at any
       time met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for some years previous
       to her marriage had resided in that city,) when his answer, if I mistake
       not, gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of
       Great Britain. I might as well here mention, that I have more than
       once heard, (without, of course, giving credit to a report
       involving so many improbabilities,) that the person of whom I speak, was
       not only by birth, but in education, an _Englishman_.

       * * * * *

       “There is one painting,” said he, without being aware of my notice of
       the tragedy--“there is still one painting which you have not seen.” And
       throwing aside a drapery, he discovered a full-length portrait of the
       Marchesa Aphrodite.

        Human art could have done no more in the delineation of her
       superhuman beauty. The same ethereal figure which stood before me the
       preceding night upon the steps of the Ducal Palace, stood before me once
       again. But in the expression of the countenance, which was beaming all
       over with smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomaly!) that
       fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the
       perfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay folded over her bosom.
       With her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase.
       One small, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth; and,
       scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to
       encircle and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most
       delicately imagined wings. My glance fell from the painting to the
       figure of my friend, and the vigorous words of Chapman’s _Bussy
       D’Ambois_, quivered instinctively upon my lips:

                            “He is up
            There like a Roman statue!  He will stand
            Till Death hath made him marble!”

       “Come,” he said at length, turning towards a table of richly enamelled
       and massive silver, upon which were a few goblets fantastically
       stained, together with two large Etruscan vases, fashioned in the same
       extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait, and
       filled with what I supposed to be Johannisberger. “Come,” he said,
       abruptly, “let us drink! It is early--but let us drink. It is _indeed_
       early,” he continued, musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer
       made the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise: “It is
       _indeed_ early--but what matters it? let us drink! Let us pour out an
       offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are
       so eager to subdue!” And, having made me pledge him in a bumper, he
       swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the wine.

       “To dream,” he continued, resuming the tone of his desultory
       conversation, as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the
       magnificent vases--“to dream has been the business of my life. I have
       therefore framed for myself, as you see, a bower of dreams. In the heart
       of Venice could I have erected a better? You behold around you, it is
       true, a medley of architectural embellishments. The chastity of Ionia
       is offended by antediluvian devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt are
       outstretched upon carpets of gold. Yet the effect is incongruous to
       the timid alone. Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are
       the bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the
       magnificent. Once I was myself a decorist; but that sublimation of folly
       has palled upon my soul. All this is now the fitter for my purpose. Like
       these arabesque censers, my spirit is writhing in fire, and the delirium
       of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land
       of real dreams whither I am now rapidly departing.” He here paused
       abruptly, bent his head to his bosom, and seemed to listen to a sound
       which I could not hear. At length, erecting his frame, he looked
       upwards, and ejaculated the lines of the Bishop of Chichester:

            _“Stay for me there!  I will not fail_
            _To meet thee in that hollow vale.”_

       In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he threw himself
       at full-length upon an ottoman.

       A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud knock at
       the door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to anticipate a second
       disturbance, when a page of Mentoni’s household burst into the room, and
       faltered out, in a voice choking with emotion, the incoherent words,
       “My mistress!--my mistress!--Poisoned!--poisoned! Oh, beautiful--oh,
       beautiful Aphrodite!”

       Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse the sleeper
       to a sense of the startling intelligence. But his limbs were rigid--his
       lips were livid--his lately beaming eyes were riveted in _death_.
       I staggered back towards the table--my hand fell upon a cracked and
       blackened goblet--and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth
       flashed suddenly over my soul.




       THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM

            Impia tortorum longos hic turba furores
            Sanguinis innocui, non satiata, aluit.
            Sospite nunc patria, fracto nunc funeris antro,
            Mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent.

            [_Quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected
            upon the site of the Jacobin Club House at Paris_.]

       I WAS sick--sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at
       length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses
       were leaving me. The sentence--the dread sentence of death--was the last
       of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound of
       the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate
       hum. It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution--perhaps from its
       association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a
       brief period; for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw;
       but with how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed
       judges. They appeared to me white--whiter than the sheet upon which
       I trace these words--and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the
       intensity of their expression of firmness--of immoveable resolution--of
       stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me
       was Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with
       a deadly locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I
       shuddered because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of
       delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable
       draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my vision
       fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At first they wore the
       aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save
       me; but then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my
       spirit, and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched
       the wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaningless
       spectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them there would be
       no help. And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note,
       the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave. The thought
       came gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full
       appreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and
       entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if magically, from
       before me; the tall candles sank into nothingness; their flames went out
       utterly; the blackness of darkness supervened; all sensations appeared
       swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades. Then
       silence, and stillness, night were the universe.

       I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was
       lost. What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even
       to describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest slumber--no! In
       delirium--no! In a swoon--no! In death--no! even in the grave all is
       not lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from the most
       profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream. Yet in a
       second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not
       that we have dreamed. In the return to life from the swoon there are two
       stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that
       of the sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon
       reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the
       first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf
       beyond. And that gulf is--what? How at least shall we distinguish its
       shadows from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I have
       termed the first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long
       interval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come?
       He who has never swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly
       familiar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating
       in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who
       ponders over the perfume of some novel flower--is not he whose brain
       grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has
       never before arrested his attention.

       Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest
       struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness
       into which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have
       dreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief periods when I
       have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch
       assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming
       unconsciousness. These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall
       figures that lifted and bore me in silence down--down--still
       down--till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the
       interminableness of the descent. They tell also of a vague horror at
       my heart, on account of that heart’s unnatural stillness. Then comes a
       sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who
       bore me (a ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of
       the limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil. After
       this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is madness--the
       madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.

       Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound--the
       tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its
       beating. Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound, and
       motion, and touch--a tingling sensation pervading my frame. Then the
       mere consciousness of existence, without thought--a condition which
       lasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and
       earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desire
       to lapse into insensibility. Then a rushing revival of soul and a
       successful effort to move. And now a full memory of the trial, of the
       judges, of the sable draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of
       the swoon. Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that
       a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to
       recall.

       So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back,
       unbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp
       and hard. There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove
       to imagine where and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to employ
       my vision. I dreaded the first glance at objects around me. It was not
       that I feared to look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest
       there should be nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation
       at heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were
       confirmed. The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. I struggled
       for breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle
       me. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I still lay quietly, and
       made effort to exercise my reason. I brought to mind the inquisitorial
       proceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition.
       The sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a very long interval
       of time had since elapsed. Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself
       actually dead. Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in
       fiction, is altogether inconsistent with real existence;--but where and
       in what state was I? The condemned to death, I knew, perished usually at
       the autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the very night of the
       day of my trial. Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next
       sacrifice, which would not take place for many months? This I at once
       saw could not be. Victims had been in immediate demand. Moreover, my
       dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors,
       and light was not altogether excluded.

       A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart,
       and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. Upon
       recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively
       in every fibre. I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all
       directions. I felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be
       impeded by the walls of a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and
       stood in cold big beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense grew
       at length intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms
       extended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope of
       catching some faint ray of light. I proceeded for many paces; but still
       all was blackness and vacancy. I breathed more freely. It seemed evident
       that mine was not, at least, the most hideous of fates.

       And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came
       thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of
       Toledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated--fables I
       had always deemed them--but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat, save
       in a whisper. Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean
       world of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited
       me? That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary
       bitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. The
       mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.

       My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. It
       was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry--very smooth, slimy, and cold.
       I followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which
       certain antique narratives had inspired me. This process, however,
       afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as
       I might make its circuit, and return to the point whence I set out,
       without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall.
       I therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led
       into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been
       exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge. I had thought of forcing the
       blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to identify my point
       of departure. The difficulty, nevertheless, was but trivial; although,
       in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first insuperable. I tore a
       part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length,
       and at right angles to the wall. In groping my way around the prison, I
       could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. So, at
       least I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon,
       or upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I staggered
       onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. My excessive fatigue
       induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me as I lay.

       Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf
       and a pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to reflect upon
       this circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. Shortly afterward, I
       resumed my tour around the prison, and with much toil came at last upon
       the fragment of the serge. Up to the period when I fell I had counted
       fifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight
       more;--when I arrived at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred
       paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to
       be fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in the
       wall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault; for
       vault I could not help supposing it to be.

       I had little object--certainly no hope--in these researches; but a vague
       curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall, I resolved
       to cross the area of the enclosure. At first I proceeded with extreme
       caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was
       treacherous with slime. At length, however, I took courage, and did not
       hesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as
       possible. I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when
       the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs.
       I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.

       In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a
       somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward,
       and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. It was this--my
       chin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper
       portion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the
       chin, touched nothing. At the same time my forehead seemed bathed in
       a clammy vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my
       nostrils. I put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen
       at the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had
       no means of ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry just
       below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let it
       fall into the abyss. For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations
       as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent; at length
       there was a sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At the
       same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as
       rapid closing of a door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed
       suddenly through the gloom, and as suddenly faded away.

       I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated
       myself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped. Another step
       before my fall, and the world had seen me no more. And the death just
       avoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous and
       frivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of its
       tyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies,
       or death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved for
       the latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until I
       trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect a
       fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.

       Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall; resolving
       there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my
       imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon.
       In other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery at
       once by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the veriest of
       cowards. Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits--that the
       sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.

       Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length I
       again slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf
       and a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied
       the vessel at a draught. It must have been drugged; for scarcely had I
       drunk, before I became irresistibly drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me--a
       sleep like that of death. How long it lasted of course, I know not;
       but when, once again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were
       visible. By a wild sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not
       at first determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the
       prison.

       In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its walls
       did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this fact occasioned
       me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what could be of less
       importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then
       the mere dimensions of my dungeon? But my soul took a wild interest in
       trifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had
       committed in my measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In my
       first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the
       period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of the
       fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the
       vault. I then slept, and upon awaking, I must have returned upon my
       steps--thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was. My
       confusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with
       the wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right.

       I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure.
       In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of
       great irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one
       arousing from lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a few
       slight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of
       the prison was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be
       iron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints
       occasioned the depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure
       was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the
       charnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiends
       in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really
       fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that the
       outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that
       the colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp
       atmosphere. I now noticed the floor, too, which was of stone. In the
       centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was
       the only one in the dungeon.

       All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my personal
       condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my
       back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood. To this
       I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle. It passed
       in many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only
       my head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much
       exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by
       my side on the floor. I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been
       removed. I say to my horror; for I was consumed with intolerable thirst.
       This thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate:
       for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.

       Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some thirty
       or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. In one
       of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention. It was
       the painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in
       lieu of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be
       the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks.
       There was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which
       caused me to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly upward
       at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I
       saw it in motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Its
       sweep was brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some minutes,
       somewhat in fear, but more in wonder. Wearied at length with observing
       its dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.

       A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw
       several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well,
       which lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I gazed, they
       came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent
       of the meat. From this it required much effort and attention to scare
       them away.

       It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I could take
       but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward. What
       I then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep of the pendulum had
       increased in extent by nearly a yard. As a natural consequence, its
       velocity was also much greater. But what mainly disturbed me was the
       idea that had perceptibly descended. I now observed--with what horror it
       is needless to say--that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent
       of glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns
       upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. Like
       a razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into
       a solid and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod of
       brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.

       I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in
       torture. My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial
       agents--the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant
       as myself--the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima
       Thule of all their punishments. The plunge into this pit I had avoided
       by the merest of accidents, I knew that surprise, or entrapment into
       torment, formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these
       dungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no part of the demon
       plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no alternative) a
       different and a milder destruction awaited me. Milder! I half smiled in
       my agony as I thought of such application of such a term.

       What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than
       mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel! Inch
       by inch--line by line--with a descent only appreciable at intervals that
       seemed ages--down and still down it came! Days passed--it might have
       been that many days passed--ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me
       with its acrid breath. The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my
       nostrils. I prayed--I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy
       descent. I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward
       against the sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell suddenly
       calm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare
       bauble.

       There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for,
       upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in
       the pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew there were demons
       who took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at
       pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt very--oh, inexpressibly sick
       and weak, as if through long inanition. Even amid the agonies of that
       period, the human nature craved food. With painful effort I outstretched
       my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the
       small remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portion
       of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of
       joy--of hope. Yet what business had I with hope? It was, as I say, a
       half formed thought--man has many such which are never completed. I felt
       that it was of joy--of hope; but felt also that it had perished in its
       formation. In vain I struggled to perfect--to regain it. Long suffering
       had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. I was an
       imbecile--an idiot.

       The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I saw
       that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart.
       It would fray the serge of my robe--it would return and repeat its
       operations--again--and again. Notwithstanding terrifically wide sweep
       (some thirty feet or more) and the hissing vigor of its descent,
       sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron, still the fraying of my
       robe would be all that, for several minutes, it would accomplish. And
       at this thought I paused. I dared not go farther than this reflection. I
       dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention--as if, in so dwelling,
       I could arrest here the descent of the steel. I forced myself to
       ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the
       garment--upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of
       cloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all this frivolity until
       my teeth were on edge.

       Down--steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting
       its downward with its lateral velocity. To the right--to the left--far
       and wide--with the shriek of a damned spirit; to my heart with the
       stealthy pace of the tiger! I alternately laughed and howled as the one
       or the other idea grew predominant.

       Down--certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three inches of
       my bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm. This
       was free only from the elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter, from
       the platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther.
       Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized
       and attempted to arrest the pendulum. I might as well have attempted to
       arrest an avalanche!

       Down--still unceasingly--still inevitably down! I gasped and struggled
       at each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep. My eyes
       followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most
       unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent,
       although death would have been a relief, oh! how unspeakable! Still I
       quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery
       would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hope
       that prompted the nerve to quiver--the frame to shrink. It was hope--the
       hope that triumphs on the rack--that whispers to the death-condemned
       even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.

       I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual
       contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over
       my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. For the first
       time during many hours--or perhaps days--I thought. It now occurred to
       me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. I
       was tied by no separate cord. The first stroke of the razorlike crescent
       athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be
       unwound from my person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in
       that case, the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest
       struggle how deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the
       torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility! Was it
       probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum?
       Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, my last hope frustrated,
       I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. The
       surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions--save in
       the path of the destroying crescent.

       Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when
       there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the
       unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously
       alluded, and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my
       brain when I raised food to my burning lips. The whole thought was now
       present--feeble, scarcely sane, scarcely definite,--but still entire.
       I proceeded at once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its
       execution.

       For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which
       I lay, had been literally swarming with rats. They were wild, bold,
       ravenous; their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for
       motionlessness on my part to make me their prey. “To what food,” I
       thought, “have they been accustomed in the well?”

       They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a
       small remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen into an habitual
       see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter: and, at length, the
       unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect. In their
       voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.
       With the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I
       thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising
       my hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still.

       At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the
       change--at the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; many
       sought the well. But this was only for a moment. I had not counted in
       vain upon their voracity. Observing that I remained without motion,
       one or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the
       surcingle. This seemed the signal for a general rush. Forth from the
       well they hurried in fresh troops. They clung to the wood--they overran
       it, and leaped in hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the
       pendulum disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied
       themselves with the anointed bandage. They pressed--they swarmed upon me
       in ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips
       sought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust,
       for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a
       heavy clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle
       would be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew
       that in more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than
       human resolution I lay still.

       Nor had I erred in my calculations--nor had I endured in vain. I at
       length felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands from my body.
       But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom. It had
       divided the serge of the robe. It had cut through the linen beneath.
       Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every
       nerve. But the moment of escape had arrived. At a wave of my hand my
       deliverers hurried tumultuously away. With a steady movement--cautious,
       sidelong, shrinking, and slow--I slid from the embrace of the bandage
       and beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was
       free.

       Free!--and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped from
       my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the
       motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some
       invisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took
       desperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free!--I
       had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse
       than death in some other. With that thought I rolled my eves
       nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something
       unusual--some change which, at first, I could not appreciate
       distinctly--it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For many
       minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain,
       unconnected conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the
       first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined
       the cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width,
       extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, which
       thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor. I
       endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture.

       As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the
       chamber broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed that,
       although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently
       distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite. These colors had
       now assumed, and were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense
       brilliancy, that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an
       aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon
       eyes, of a wild and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand
       directions, where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the
       lurid lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard
       as unreal.

       Unreal!--Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of
       the vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded the prison! A
       deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies!
       A richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of
       blood. I panted! I gasped for breath! There could be no doubt of the
       design of my tormentors--oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of
       men! I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the
       thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness
       of the well came over my soul like balm. I rushed to its deadly brink.
       I threw my straining vision below. The glare from the enkindled roof
       illumined its inmost recesses. Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit
       refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw. At length it forced--it
       wrestled its way into my soul--it burned itself in upon my shuddering
       reason.--Oh! for a voice to speak!--oh! horror!--oh! any horror but
       this! With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my
       hands--weeping bitterly.

       The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as
       with a fit of the ague. There had been a second change in the cell--and
       now the change was obviously in the form. As before, it was in vain that
       I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking
       place. But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had
       been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying
       with the King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of
       its iron angles were now acute--two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful
       difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. In an
       instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. But
       the alteration stopped not here-I neither hoped nor desired it to stop.
       I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal
       peace. “Death,” I said, “any death but that of the pit!” Fool! might I
       have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron
       to urge me? Could I resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstand
       its pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a
       rapidity that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and of
       course, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I shrank
       back--but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward. At length
       for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold
       on the firm floor of the prison. I struggled no more, but the agony of
       my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. I
       felt that I tottered upon the brink--I averted my eyes--

       There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud blast as of
       many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! The
       fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell,
       fainting, into the abyss. It was that of General Lasalle. The French
       army had entered Toledo. The Inquisition was in the hands of its
       enemies.




       THE PREMATURE BURIAL

       THERE are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, but
       which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction.
       These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend or
       to disgust. They are with propriety handled only when the severity and
       majesty of Truth sanctify and sustain them. We thrill, for example, with
       the most intense of “pleasurable pain” over the accounts of the Passage
       of the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London,
       of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the hundred
       and twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta. But in these
       accounts it is the fact----it is the reality----it is the history which
       excites. As inventions, we should regard them with simple abhorrence.

       I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities
       on record; but in these it is the extent, not less than the character
       of the calamity, which so vividly impresses the fancy. I need not remind
       the reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries,
       I might have selected many individual instances more replete with
       essential suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster.
       The true wretchedness, indeed--the ultimate woe----is particular, not
       diffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the unit,
       and never by man the mass----for this let us thank a merciful God!

       To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific of these
       extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality. That it has
       frequently, very frequently, so fallen will scarcely be denied by those
       who think. The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best
       shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other
       begins? We know that there are diseases in which occur total cessations
       of all the apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these
       cessations are merely suspensions, properly so called. They are only
       temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain period
       elapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in motion the
       magic pinions and the wizard wheels. The silver cord was not for ever
       loosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably broken. But where, meantime, was
       the soul?

       Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, a priori that such
       causes must produce such effects----that the well-known occurrence of
       such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now and
       then, to premature interments--apart from this consideration, we have
       the direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a
       vast number of such interments have actually taken place. I might refer
       at once, if necessary to a hundred well authenticated instances. One of
       very remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh
       in the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago, in the
       neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a painful, intense,
       and widely-extended excitement. The wife of one of the most respectable
       citizens--a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress--was seized with
       a sudden and unaccountable illness, which completely baffled the skill
       of her physicians. After much suffering she died, or was supposed to
       die. No one suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she was
       not actually dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of death.
       The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips were of
       the usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no warmth.
       Pulsation had ceased. For three days the body was preserved unburied,
       during which it had acquired a stony rigidity. The funeral, in short,
       was hastened, on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed to be
       decomposition.

       The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three subsequent
       years, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term it was opened
       for the reception of a sarcophagus;----but, alas! how fearful a shock
       awaited the husband, who, personally, threw open the door! As its
       portals swung outwardly back, some white-apparelled object fell rattling
       within his arms. It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded
       shroud.

       A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within
       two days after her entombment; that her struggles within the coffin had
       caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the floor, where it was so
       broken as to permit her escape. A lamp which had been accidentally
       left, full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have been
       exhausted, however, by evaporation. On the uttermost of the steps which
       led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin,
       with which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by
       striking the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably swooned, or
       possibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing, her shroud became
       entangled in some iron--work which projected interiorly. Thus she
       remained, and thus she rotted, erect.

       In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France,
       attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that
       truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the story was a
       Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family,
       of wealth, and of great personal beauty. Among her numerous suitors was
       Julien Bossuet, a poor litterateur, or journalist of Paris. His talents
       and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress,
       by whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth
       decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, a
       banker and a diplomatist of some eminence. After marriage, however, this
       gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her.
       Having passed with him some wretched years, she died,----at least her
       condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw
       her. She was buried----not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in the
       village of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by the
       memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the capital to
       the remote province in which the village lies, with the romantic purpose
       of disinterring the corpse, and possessing himself of its luxuriant
       tresses. He reaches the grave. At midnight he unearths the coffin, opens
       it, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the
       unclosing of the beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been buried
       alive. Vitality had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by
       the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken
       for death. He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. He
       employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical
       learning. In fine, she revived. She recognized her preserver. She
       remained with him until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered her
       original health. Her woman’s heart was not adamant, and this last
       lesson of love sufficed to soften it. She bestowed it upon Bossuet.
       She returned no more to her husband, but, concealing from him her
       resurrection, fled with her lover to America. Twenty years afterward,
       the two returned to France, in the persuasion that time had so greatly
       altered the lady’s appearance that her friends would be unable to
       recognize her. They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting,
       Monsieur Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife.
       This claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her
       resistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the long
       lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but legally, the
       authority of the husband.

       The “Chirurgical Journal” of Leipsic--a periodical of high authority
       and merit, which some American bookseller would do well to translate
       and republish, records in a late number a very distressing event of the
       character in question.

       An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust
       health, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very severe
       contusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at once; the
       skull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger was apprehended.
       Trepanning was accomplished successfully. He was bled, and many other of
       the ordinary means of relief were adopted. Gradually, however, he fell
       into a more and more hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was
       thought that he died.

       The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in one of
       the public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday. On the Sunday
       following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, much thronged
       with visiters, and about noon an intense excitement was created by
       the declaration of a peasant that, while sitting upon the grave of
       the officer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth, as if
       occasioned by some one struggling beneath. At first little attention was
       paid to the man’s asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged
       obstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length their
       natural effect upon the crowd. Spades were hurriedly procured, and the
       grave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a few minutes so far thrown
       open that the head of its occupant appeared. He was then seemingly dead;
       but he sat nearly erect within his coffin, the lid of which, in his
       furious struggles, he had partially uplifted.

       He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there pronounced
       to be still living, although in an asphytic condition. After some hours
       he revived, recognized individuals of his acquaintance, and, in broken
       sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave.

       From what he related, it was clear that he must have been conscious
       of life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before lapsing into
       insensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an
       exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was necessarily admitted.
       He heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make
       himself heard in turn. It was the tumult within the grounds of the
       cemetery, he said, which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but
       no sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors
       of his position.

       This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in a fair
       way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the quackeries of medical
       experiment. The galvanic battery was applied, and he suddenly expired in
       one of those ecstatic paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.

       The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my memory
       a well known and very extraordinary case in point, where its action
       proved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of London,
       who had been interred for two days. This occurred in 1831, and created,
       at the time, a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subject
       of converse.

       The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus fever,
       accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity
       of his medical attendants. Upon his seeming decease, his friends were
       requested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but declined to permit
       it. As often happens, when such refusals are made, the practitioners
       resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in private.
       Arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of
       body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third night
       after the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight
       feet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private
       hospitals.

       An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen,
       when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an
       application of the battery. One experiment succeeded another, and the
       customary effects supervened, with nothing to characterize them in any
       respect, except, upon one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree
       of life-likeness in the convulsive action.

       It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought expedient,
       at length, to proceed at once to the dissection. A student, however, was
       especially desirous of testing a theory of his own, and insisted upon
       applying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles. A rough gash was
       made, and a wire hastily brought in contact, when the patient, with a
       hurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped
       into the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few
       seconds, and then--spoke. What he said was unintelligible, but words
       were uttered; the syllabification was distinct. Having spoken, he fell
       heavily to the floor.

       For some moments all were paralyzed with awe--but the urgency of the
       case soon restored them their presence of mind. It was seen that Mr.
       Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon. Upon exhibition of ether he
       revived and was rapidly restored to health, and to the society of his
       friends--from whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation was
       withheld, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended. Their
       wonder--their rapturous astonishment--may be conceived.

       The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is
       involved in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that at no period
       was he altogether insensible--that, dully and confusedly, he was aware
       of everything which happened to him, from the moment in which he was
       pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in which he fell swooning to
       the floor of the hospital. “I am alive,” were the uncomprehended words
       which, upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room, he had
       endeavored, in his extremity, to utter.

       It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these--but I
       forbear--for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the fact that
       premature interments occur. When we reflect how very rarely, from the
       nature of the case, we have it in our power to detect them, we must
       admit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance. Scarcely,
       in truth, is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to any
       great extent, that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the
       most fearful of suspicions.

       Fearful indeed the suspicion--but more fearful the doom! It may be
       asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adapted
       to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as is
       burial before death. The unendurable oppression of the lungs--the
       stifling fumes from the damp earth--the clinging to the death
       garments--the rigid embrace of the narrow house--the blackness of the
       absolute Night--the silence like a sea that overwhelms--the unseen but
       palpable presence of the Conqueror Worm--these things, with the thoughts
       of the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would fly to
       save us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of this
       fate they can never be informed--that our hopeless portion is that of
       the really dead--these considerations, I say, carry into the heart,
       which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable horror
       from which the most daring imagination must recoil. We know of nothing
       so agonizing upon Earth--we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the
       realms of the nethermost Hell. And thus all narratives upon this topic
       have an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through
       the sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly
       depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated. What I
       have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge--of my own positive and
       personal experience.

       For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder
       which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of a more
       definitive title. Although both the immediate and the predisposing
       causes, and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are still
       mysterious, its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well
       understood. Its variations seem to be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the
       patient lies, for a day only, or even for a shorter period, in a species
       of exaggerated lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but
       the pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces of
       warmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek;
       and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid,
       unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs. Then again the duration
       of the trance is for weeks--even for months; while the closest scrutiny,
       and the most rigorous medical tests, fail to establish any material
       distinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of
       absolute death. Very usually he is saved from premature interment solely
       by the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to
       catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all, by
       the non-appearance of decay. The advances of the malady are, luckily,
       gradual. The first manifestations, although marked, are unequivocal. The
       fits grow successively more and more distinctive, and endure each for a
       longer term than the preceding. In this lies the principal security from
       inhumation. The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme
       character which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be
       consigned alive to the tomb.

       My own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in
       medical books. Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little by
       little, into a condition of hemi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this
       condition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking,
       to think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the
       presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis of
       the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation. At other
       times I was quickly and impetuously smitten. I grew sick, and numb, and
       chilly, and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once. Then, for weeks, all
       was void, and black, and silent, and Nothing became the universe.
       Total annihilation could be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke,
       however, with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the
       seizure. Just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar
       who roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night--just
       so tardily--just so wearily--just so cheerily came back the light of the
       Soul to me.

       Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appeared
       to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one
       prevalent malady--unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep
       may be looked upon as superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I could
       never gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always
       remained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity;--the
       mental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a
       condition of absolute abeyance.

       In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of moral
       distress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel, I talked “of worms, of
       tombs, and epitaphs.” I was lost in reveries of death, and the idea
       of premature burial held continual possession of my brain. The ghastly
       Danger to which I was subjected haunted me day and night. In the former,
       the torture of meditation was excessive--in the latter, supreme. When
       the grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of
       thought, I shook--shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. When
       Nature could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that
       I consented to sleep--for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I
       might find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I sank into
       slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, above
       which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, the
       one sepulchral Idea.

       From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams,
       I select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I was immersed in
       a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration and profundity. Suddenly
       there came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering
       voice whispered the word “Arise!” within my ear.

       I sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the figure of him
       who had aroused me. I could call to mind neither the period at which I
       had fallen into the trance, nor the locality in which I then lay. While
       I remained motionless, and busied in endeavors to collect my thought,
       the cold hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly,
       while the gibbering voice said again:

       “Arise! did I not bid thee arise?”

       “And who,” I demanded, “art thou?”

       “I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,” replied the voice,
       mournfully; “I was mortal, but am fiend. I was merciless, but am
       pitiful. Thou dost feel that I shudder.--My teeth chatter as I speak,
       yet it is not with the chilliness of the night--of the night without
       end. But this hideousness is insufferable. How canst thou tranquilly
       sleep? I cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies. These sights
       are more than I can bear. Get thee up! Come with me into the outer
       Night, and let me unfold to thee the graves. Is not this a spectacle of
       woe?--Behold!”

       I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist,
       had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind, and from each
       issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay, so that I could see into
       the innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in their
       sad and solemn slumbers with the worm. But alas! the real sleepers were
       fewer, by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there
       was a feeble struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from
       out the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling
       from the garments of the buried. And of those who seemed tranquilly
       to repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a greater or less
       degree, the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been
       entombed. And the voice again said to me as I gazed:

       “Is it not--oh! is it not a pitiful sight?”--but, before I could find
       words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the phosphoric
       lights expired, and the graves were closed with a sudden violence, while
       from out them arose a tumult of despairing cries, saying again: “Is it
       not--O, God, is it not a very pitiful sight?”

       Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended their
       terrific influence far into my waking hours. My nerves became thoroughly
       unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror. I hesitated to ride, or
       to walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home.
       In fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence
       of those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into
       one of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition could
       be ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends.
       I dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, they
       might be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable. I even went so
       far as to fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to
       consider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid
       of me altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the
       most solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under no
       circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially
       advanced as to render farther preservation impossible. And, even
       then, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason--would accept no
       consolation. I entered into a series of elaborate precautions. Among
       other things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being
       readily opened from within. The slightest pressure upon a long lever
       that extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back.
       There were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light,
       and convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach of
       the coffin intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly and softly
       padded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the
       vault-door, with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest
       movement of the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides
       all this, there was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell,
       the rope of which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the
       coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse. But, alas?
       what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man? Not even these
       well-contrived securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of
       living inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!

       There arrived an epoch--as often before there had arrived--in which I
       found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first
       feeble and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly--with a tortoise
       gradation--approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A torpid
       uneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No care--no hope--no
       effort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears; then,
       after a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in the
       extremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence,
       during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a
       brief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the
       slight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric
       shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in
       torrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first positive
       effort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember. And now a
       partial and evanescent success. And now the memory has so far regained
       its dominion, that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state. I feel
       that I am not awaking from ordinary sleep. I recollect that I have been
       subject to catalepsy. And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean,
       my shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger--by the one
       spectral and ever-prevalent idea.

       For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained without
       motion. And why? I could not summon courage to move. I dared not
       make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate--and yet there was
       something at my heart which whispered me it was sure. Despair--such as
       no other species of wretchedness ever calls into being--despair alone
       urged me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes.
       I uplifted them. It was dark--all dark. I knew that the fit was over. I
       knew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed. I knew that I
       had now fully recovered the use of my visual faculties--and yet it was
       dark--all dark--the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that
       endureth for evermore.

       I endeavored to shriek; and my lips and my parched tongue moved
       convulsively together in the attempt--but no voice issued from the
       cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent
       mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at every elaborate and
       struggling inspiration.

       The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me that
       they were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I felt, too, that I lay
       upon some hard substance, and by something similar my sides were,
       also, closely compressed. So far, I had not ventured to stir any of my
       limbs--but now I violently threw up my arms, which had been lying at
       length, with the wrists crossed. They struck a solid wooden substance,
       which extended above my person at an elevation of not more than six
       inches from my face. I could no longer doubt that I reposed within a
       coffin at last.

       And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub
       Hope--for I thought of my precautions. I writhed, and made spasmodic
       exertions to force open the lid: it would not move. I felt my wrists for
       the bell-rope: it was not to be found. And now the Comforter fled for
       ever, and a still sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for I could not
       help perceiving the absence of the paddings which I had so carefully
       prepared--and then, too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong
       peculiar odor of moist earth. The conclusion was irresistible. I was
       not within the vault. I had fallen into a trance while absent from
       home--while among strangers--when, or how, I could not remember--and
       it was they who had buried me as a dog--nailed up in some common
       coffin--and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary and
       nameless grave.

       As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost
       chambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. And in this
       second endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and continuous shriek, or
       yell of agony, resounded through the realms of the subterranean Night.

       “Hillo! hillo, there!” said a gruff voice, in reply.

       “What the devil’s the matter now!” said a second.

       “Get out o’ that!” said a third.

       “What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a
       cattymount?” said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken
       without ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-looking
       individuals. They did not arouse me from my slumber--for I was wide
       awake when I screamed--but they restored me to the full possession of my
       memory.

       This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied by a
       friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the
       banks of the James River. Night approached, and we were overtaken by
       a storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and
       laden with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. We made
       the best of it, and passed the night on board. I slept in one of the
       only two berths in the vessel--and the berths of a sloop of sixty or
       twenty tons need scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no
       bedding of any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distance
       of its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I found it
       a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in. Nevertheless, I
       slept soundly, and the whole of my vision--for it was no dream, and no
       nightmare--arose naturally from the circumstances of my position--from
       my ordinary bias of thought--and from the difficulty, to which I have
       alluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory,
       for a long time after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me were
       the crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From the
       load itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was a
       silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of my
       customary nightcap.

       The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for the
       time, to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully--they were
       inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their very
       excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion. My soul acquired
       tone--acquired temper. I went abroad. I took vigorous exercise. I
       breathed the free air of Heaven. I thought upon other subjects than
       Death. I discarded my medical books. “Buchan” I burned. I read no “Night
       Thoughts”--no fustian about churchyards--no bugaboo tales--such as
       this. In short, I became a new man, and lived a man’s life. From that
       memorable night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with
       them vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had been
       less the consequence than the cause.

       There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of
       our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell--but the imagination
       of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas!
       the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether
       fanciful--but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage
       down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us--they must be
       suffered to slumber, or we perish.




       THE DOMAIN OF ARNHEIM

            The garden like a lady fair was cut,
            That lay as if she slumbered in delight,
            And to the open skies her eyes did shut.
            The azure fields of Heaven were ‘sembled right
            In a large round, set with the flowers of light.
            The flowers de luce, and the round sparks of dew.
            That hung upon their azure leaves did shew
            Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue.
            Giles Fletcher.

       FROM his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend Ellison
       along. Nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense. I
       mean it as synonymous with happiness. The person of whom I speak seemed
       born for the purpose of foreshadowing the doctrines of Turgot, Price,
       Priestley, and Condorcet--of exemplifying by individual instance
       what has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief
       existence of Ellison I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma, that in
       man’s very nature lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of bliss.
       An anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that in
       general, from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the
       wretchedness of mankind--that as a species we have in our possession the
       as yet unwrought elements of content--and that, even now, in the present
       darkness and madness of all thought on the great question of the social
       condition, it is not impossible that man, the individual, under certain
       unusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may be happy.

       With opinions such as these my young friend, too, was fully imbued, and
       thus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which
       distinguished his life was, in great measure, the result of preconcert.
       It is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which,
       now and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison
       would have found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary success
       of his life, into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those
       of pre-eminent endowments. But it is by no means my object to pen an
       essay on happiness. The ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few
       words. He admitted but four elementary principles, or more strictly,
       conditions of bliss. That which he considered chief was (strange to
       say!) the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open
       air. “The health,” he said, “attainable by other means is scarcely worth
       the name.” He instanced the ecstasies of the fox-hunter, and pointed to
       the tillers of the earth, the only people who, as a class, can be fairly
       considered happier than others. His second condition was the love of
       woman. His third, and most difficult of realization, was the contempt
       of ambition. His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he held
       that, other things being equal, the extent of attainable happiness was
       in proportion to the spirituality of this object.

       Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts
       lavished upon him by fortune. In personal grace and beauty he exceeded
       all men. His intellect was of that order to which the acquisition of
       knowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a necessity. His
       family was one of the most illustrious of the empire. His bride was the
       loveliest and most devoted of women. His possessions had been always
       ample; but on the attainment of his majority, it was discovered that
       one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf
       which startle the whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom
       fail radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their
       objects.

       It appears that about a hundred years before Mr. Ellison’s coming of
       age, there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright Ellison.
       This gentleman had amassed a princely fortune, and, having no immediate
       connections, conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate
       for a century after his decease. Minutely and sagaciously directing the
       various modes of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the
       nearest of blood, bearing the name of Ellison, who should be alive at
       the end of the hundred years. Many attempts had been made to set aside
       this singular bequest; their ex post facto character rendered them
       abortive; but the attention of a jealous government was aroused, and a
       legislative act finally obtained, forbidding all similar accumulations.
       This act, however, did not prevent young Ellison from entering into
       possession, on his twenty-first birthday, as the heir of his ancestor
       Seabright, of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars.
       (*1)

       When it had become known that such was the enormous wealth inherited,
       there were, of course, many speculations as to the mode of its disposal.
       The magnitude and the immediate availability of the sum bewildered all
       who thought on the topic. The possessor of any appreciable amount of
       money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things.
       With riches merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have
       been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable
       extravagances of his time--or busying himself with political
       intrigue--or aiming at ministerial power--or purchasing increase
       of nobility--or collecting large museums of virtu--or playing the
       munificent patron of letters, of science, of art--or endowing, and
       bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity. But for the
       inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the heir, these objects
       and all ordinary objects were felt to afford too limited a field.
       Recourse was had to figures, and these but sufficed to confound. It was
       seen that, even at three per cent., the annual income of the inheritance
       amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand
       dollars; which was one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand
       per month; or thirty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty-six per day;
       or one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour; or six and twenty
       dollars for every minute that flew. Thus the usual track of supposition
       was thoroughly broken up. Men knew not what to imagine. There were some
       who even conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest himself of at least
       one-half of his fortune, as of utterly superfluous opulence--enriching
       whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance. To the
       nearest of these he did, in fact, abandon the very unusual wealth which
       was his own before the inheritance.

       I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up his
       mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends.
       Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision. In regard to
       individual charities he had satisfied his conscience. In the possibility
       of any improvement, properly so called, being effected by man himself in
       the general condition of man, he had (I am sorry to confess it) little
       faith. Upon the whole, whether happily or unhappily, he was thrown back,
       in very great measure, upon self.

       In the widest and noblest sense he was a poet. He comprehended,
       moreover, the true character, the august aims, the supreme majesty and
       dignity of the poetic sentiment. The fullest, if not the sole proper
       satisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the
       creation of novel forms of beauty. Some peculiarities, either in his
       early education, or in the nature of his intellect, had tinged with
       what is termed materialism all his ethical speculations; and it was this
       bias, perhaps, which led him to believe that the most advantageous at
       least, if not the sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise, lies
       in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus it
       happened he became neither musician nor poet--if we use this latter term
       in its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been that he neglected
       to become either, merely in pursuance of his idea that in contempt of
       ambition is to be found one of the essential principles of happiness on
       earth. Is it not indeed, possible that, while a high order of genius
       is necessarily ambitious, the highest is above that which is termed
       ambition? And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Milton
       have contentedly remained “mute and inglorious?” I believe that the
       world has never seen--and that, unless through some series of accidents
       goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion, the world
       will never see--that full extent of triumphant execution, in the richer
       domains of art, of which the human nature is absolutely capable.

       Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived more
       profoundly enamored of music and poetry. Under other circumstances than
       those which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have become
       a painter. Sculpture, although in its nature rigorously poetical was too
       limited in its extent and consequences, to have occupied, at any time,
       much of his attention. And I have now mentioned all the provinces in
       which the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it
       capable of expatiating. But Ellison maintained that the richest, the
       truest, and most natural, if not altogether the most extensive province,
       had been unaccountably neglected. No definition had spoken of the
       landscape-gardener as of the poet; yet it seemed to my friend that the
       creation of the landscape-garden offered to the proper Muse the most
       magnificent of opportunities. Here, indeed, was the fairest field for
       the display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of
       novel beauty; the elements to enter into combination being, by a vast
       superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. In the
       multiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees, he recognised the
       most direct and energetic efforts of Nature at physical loveliness. And
       in the direction or concentration of this effort--or, more properly,
       in its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth--he
       perceived that he should be employing the best means--laboring to the
       greatest advantage--in the fulfilment, not only of his own destiny as
       poet, but of the august purposes for which the Deity had implanted the
       poetic sentiment in man.

       “Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.” In his
       explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much toward solving
       what has always seemed to me an enigma:--I mean the fact (which none
       but the ignorant dispute) that no such combination of scenery exists in
       nature as the painter of genius may produce. No such paradises are to
       be found in reality as have glowed on the canvas of Claude. In the most
       enchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a defect
       or an excess--many excesses and defects. While the component parts may
       defy, individually, the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement
       of these parts will always be susceptible of improvement. In short, no
       position can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth,
       from which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter of
       offence in what is termed the “composition” of the landscape. And
       yet how unintelligible is this! In all other matters we are justly
       instructed to regard nature as supreme. With her details we shrink from
       competition. Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to
       improve the proportions of the lily of the valley? The criticism which
       says, of sculpture or portraiture, that here nature is to be exalted or
       idealized rather than imitated, is in error. No pictorial or sculptural
       combinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach the
       living and breathing beauty. In landscape alone is the principle of the
       critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it is but the headlong
       spirit of generalization which has led him to pronounce it true
       throughout all the domains of art. Having, I say, felt its truth here;
       for the feeling is no affectation or chimera. The mathematics afford no
       more absolute demonstrations than the sentiments of his art yields the
       artist. He not only believes, but positively knows, that such and
       such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone
       constitute the true beauty. His reasons, however, have not yet been
       matured into expression. It remains for a more profound analysis
       than the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them.
       Nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the voice of
       all his brethren. Let a “composition” be defective; let an emendation
       be wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be
       submitted to every artist in the world; by each will its necessity
       be admitted. And even far more than this:--in remedy of the defective
       composition, each insulated member of the fraternity would have
       suggested the identical emendation.

       I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature
       susceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her susceptibility of
       improvement at this one point, was a mystery I had been unable to solve.
       My own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitive
       intention of nature would have so arranged the earth’s surface as to
       have fulfilled at all points man’s sense of perfection in the beautiful,
       the sublime, or the picturesque; but that this primitive intention had
       been frustrated by the known geological disturbances--disturbances of
       form and color--grouping, in the correction or allaying of which lies
       the soul of art. The force of this idea was much weakened, however, by
       the necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal
       and unadapted to any purpose. It was Ellison who suggested that
       they were prognostic of death. He thus explained:--Admit the earthly
       immortality of man to have been the first intention. We have then the
       primitive arrangement of the earth’s surface adapted to his blissful
       estate, as not existent but designed. The disturbances were the
       preparations for his subsequently conceived deathful condition.

       “Now,” said my friend, “what we regard as exaltation of the landscape
       may be really such, as respects only the moral or human point of view.
       Each alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemish
       in the picture, if we can suppose this picture viewed at large--in
       mass--from some point distant from the earth’s surface, although not
       beyond the limits of its atmosphere. It is easily understood that what
       might improve a closely scrutinized detail, may at the same time injure
       a general or more distantly observed effect. There may be a class of
       beings, human once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from afar,
       our disorder may seem order--our unpicturesqueness picturesque, in a
       word, the earth-angels, for whose scrutiny more especially than our own,
       and for whose death-refined appreciation of the beautiful, may have
       been set in array by God the wide landscape-gardens of the hemispheres.”

       In the course of discussion, my friend quoted some passages from a
       writer on landscape-gardening who has been supposed to have well treated
       his theme:

       “There are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening, the natural
       and the artificial. One seeks to recall the original beauty of the
       country, by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery, cultivating
       trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land;
       detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size,
       proportion, and color which, hid from the common observer, are revealed
       everywhere to the experienced student of nature. The result of the
       natural style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all
       defects and incongruities--in the prevalence of a healthy harmony and
       order--than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles. The
       artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes
       to gratify. It has a certain general relation to the various styles of
       building. There are the stately avenues and retirements of Versailles;
       Italian terraces; and a various mixed old English style, which
       bears some relation to the domestic Gothic or English Elizabethan
       architecture. Whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial
       landscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it
       a great beauty. This is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of
       order and design, and partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-covered
       balustrade, calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed
       there in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of
       care and human interest.”

       “From what I have already observed,” said Ellison, “you will understand
       that I reject the idea, here expressed, of recalling the original beauty
       of the country. The original beauty is never so great as that which may
       be introduced. Of course, every thing depends on the selection of a
       spot with capabilities. What is said about detecting and bringing into
       practice nice relations of size, proportion, and color, is one of those
       mere vaguenesses of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought.
       The phrase quoted may mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in no
       degree. That the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen
       rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the
       creation of any special wonders or miracles, is a proposition better
       suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid
       dreams of the man of genius. The negative merit suggested appertains to
       that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate Addison into
       apotheosis. In truth, while that virtue which consists in the mere
       avoidance of vice appeals directly to the understanding, and can thus be
       circumscribed in rule, the loftier virtue, which flames in creation, can
       be apprehended in its results alone. Rule applies but to the merits of
       denial--to the excellencies which refrain. Beyond these, the critical
       art can but suggest. We may be instructed to build a “Cato,” but we
       are in vain told how to conceive a Parthenon or an “Inferno.” The
       thing done, however; the wonder accomplished; and the capacity for
       apprehension becomes universal. The sophists of the negative school who,
       through inability to create, have scoffed at creation, are now found
       the loudest in applause. What, in its chrysalis condition of principle,
       affronted their demure reason, never fails, in its maturity of
       accomplishment, to extort admiration from their instinct of beauty.

       “The author’s observations on the artificial style,” continued Ellison,
       “are less objectionable. A mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to
       it a great beauty. This is just; as also is the reference to the sense
       of human interest. The principle expressed is incontrovertible--but
       there may be something beyond it. There may be an object in keeping with
       the principle--an object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed
       by individuals, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the
       landscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely human
       interest could bestow. A poet, having very unusual pecuniary resources,
       might, while retaining the necessary idea of art or culture, or, as
       our author expresses it, of interest, so imbue his designs at once with
       extent and novelty of beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual
       interference. It will be seen that, in bringing about such result, he
       secures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving his
       work of the harshness or technicality of the worldly art. In the
       most rugged of wildernesses--in the most savage of the scenes of pure
       nature--there is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is apparent
       to reflection only; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling.
       Now let us suppose this sense of the Almighty design to be one step
       depressed--to be brought into something like harmony or consistency with
       the sense of human art--to form an intermedium between the two:--let
       us imagine, for example, a landscape whose combined vastness and
       definitiveness--whose united beauty, magnificence, and strangeness,
       shall convey the idea of care, or culture, or superintendence, on the
       part of beings superior, yet akin to humanity--then the sentiment of
       interest is preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the
       air of an intermediate or secondary nature--a nature which is not God,
       nor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense of the
       handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God.”

       It was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a vision
       such as this--in the free exercise in the open air ensured by the
       personal superintendence of his plans--in the unceasing object which
       these plans afforded--in the high spirituality of the object--in
       the contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel--in the
       perennial springs with which it gratified, without possibility of
       satiating, that one master passion of his soul, the thirst for beauty,
       above all, it was in the sympathy of a woman, not unwomanly, whose
       loveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere of
       Paradise, that Ellison thought to find, and found, exemption from
       the ordinary cares of humanity, with a far greater amount of positive
       happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Stael.

       I despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of the
       marvels which my friend did actually accomplish. I wish to describe, but
       am disheartened by the difficulty of description, and hesitate between
       detail and generality. Perhaps the better course will be to unite the
       two in their extremes.

       Mr. Ellison’s first step regarded, of course, the choice of a locality,
       and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point, when the luxuriant
       nature of the Pacific Islands arrested his attention. In fact, he
       had made up his mind for a voyage to the South Seas, when a night’s
       reflection induced him to abandon the idea. “Were I misanthropic,” he
       said, “such a locale would suit me. The thoroughness of its insulation
       and seclusion, and the difficulty of ingress and egress, would in such
       case be the charm of charms; but as yet I am not Timon. I wish the
       composure but not the depression of solitude. There must remain with me
       a certain control over the extent and duration of my repose. There will
       be frequent hours in which I shall need, too, the sympathy of the poetic
       in what I have done. Let me seek, then, a spot not far from a populous
       city--whose vicinity, also, will best enable me to execute my plans.”

       In search of a suitable place so situated, Ellison travelled for several
       years, and I was permitted to accompany him. A thousand spots with
       which I was enraptured he rejected without hesitation, for reasons which
       satisfied me, in the end, that he was right. We came at length to an
       elevated table-land of wonderful fertility and beauty, affording a
       panoramic prospect very little less in extent than that of Aetna, and,
       in Ellison’s opinion as well as my own, surpassing the far-famed view
       from that mountain in all the true elements of the picturesque.

       “I am aware,” said the traveller, as he drew a sigh of deep delight
       after gazing on this scene, entranced, for nearly an hour, “I know that
       here, in my circumstances, nine-tenths of the most fastidious of men
       would rest content. This panorama is indeed glorious, and I should
       rejoice in it but for the excess of its glory. The taste of all the
       architects I have ever known leads them, for the sake of ‘prospect,’ to
       put up buildings on hill-tops. The error is obvious. Grandeur in any of
       its moods, but especially in that of extent, startles, excites--and then
       fatigues, depresses. For the occasional scene nothing can be better--for
       the constant view nothing worse. And, in the constant view, the most
       objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent; the worst phase of
       extent, that of distance. It is at war with the sentiment and with the
       sense of seclusion--the sentiment and sense which we seek to humor in
       ‘retiring to the country.’ In looking from the summit of a mountain we
       cannot help feeling abroad in the world. The heart-sick avoid distant
       prospects as a pestilence.”

       It was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our search that
       we found a locality with which Ellison professed himself satisfied. It
       is, of course, needless to say where was the locality. The late death of
       my friend, in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain classes
       of visiters, has given to Arnheim a species of secret and subdued if
       not solemn celebrity, similar in kind, although infinitely superior in
       degree, to that which so long distinguished Fonthill.

       The usual approach to Arnheim was by the river. The visiter left the
       city in the early morning. During the forenoon he passed between shores
       of a tranquil and domestic beauty, on which grazed innumerable sheep,
       their white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows. By
       degrees the idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral
       care. This slowly became merged in a sense of retirement--this again in
       a consciousness of solitude. As the evening approached, the channel grew
       more narrow, the banks more and more precipitous; and these latter
       were clothed in rich, more profuse, and more sombre foliage. The water
       increased in transparency. The stream took a thousand turns, so that at
       no moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance
       than a furlong. At every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an
       enchanted circle, having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage,
       a roof of ultramarine satin, and no floor--the keel balancing itself
       with admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which, by some accident
       having been turned upside down, floated in constant company with the
       substantial one, for the purpose of sustaining it. The channel now
       became a gorge--although the term is somewhat inapplicable, and I employ
       it merely because the language has no word which better represents
       the most striking--not the most distinctive--feature of the scene. The
       character of gorge was maintained only in the height and parallelism of
       the shores; it was lost altogether in their other traits. The walls of
       the ravine (through which the clear water still tranquilly flowed) arose
       to an elevation of a hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fifty
       feet, and inclined so much toward each other as, in a great measure, to
       shut out the light of day; while the long plume-like moss which depended
       densely from the intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave the whole
       chasm an air of funereal gloom. The windings became more frequent and
       intricate, and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves, so
       that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction. He was, moreover,
       enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange. The thought of nature
       still remained, but her character seemed to have undergone modification,
       there was a weird symmetry, a thrilling uniformity, a wizard propriety
       in these her works. Not a dead branch--not a withered leaf--not a stray
       pebble--not a patch of the brown earth was anywhere visible. The crystal
       water welled up against the clean granite, or the unblemished moss, with
       a sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.

       Having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the gloom
       deepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel
       brought it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a circular basin of
       very considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge. It
       was about two hundred yards in diameter, and girt in at all points but
       one--that immediately fronting the vessel as it entered--by hills equal
       in general height to the walls of the chasm, although of a thoroughly
       different character. Their sides sloped from the water’s edge at an
       angle of some forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from base to
       summit--not a perceptible point escaping--in a drapery of the most
       gorgeous flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible among the
       sea of odorous and fluctuating color. This basin was of great depth, but
       so transparent was the water that the bottom, which seemed to consist of
       a thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles, was distinctly visible
       by glimpses--that is to say, whenever the eye could permit itself not
       to see, far down in the inverted heaven, the duplicate blooming of the
       hills. On these latter there were no trees, nor even shrubs of any size.
       The impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness,
       warmth, color, quietude, uniformity, softness, delicacy, daintiness,
       voluptuousness, and a miraculous extremeness of culture that suggested
       dreams of a new race of fairies, laborious, tasteful, magnificent, and
       fastidious; but as the eye traced upward the myriad-tinted slope, from
       its sharp junction with the water to its vague termination amid the
       folds of overhanging cloud, it became, indeed, difficult not to fancy
       a panoramic cataract of rubies, sapphires, opals, and golden onyxes,
       rolling silently out of the sky.

       The visiter, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the
       ravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun,
       which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon, but which now
       confronts him, and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitless
       vista seen through another chasm-like rift in the hills.

       But here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far, and
       descends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque devices in
       vivid scarlet, both within and without. The poop and beak of this boat
       arise high above the water, with sharp points, so that the general form
       is that of an irregular crescent. It lies on the surface of the bay
       with the proud grace of a swan. On its ermined floor reposes a single
       feathery paddle of satin-wood; but no oarsmen or attendant is to be
       seen. The guest is bidden to be of good cheer--that the fates will take
       care of him. The larger vessel disappears, and he is left alone in the
       canoe, which lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake.
       While he considers what course to pursue, however, he becomes aware of a
       gentle movement in the fairy bark. It slowly swings itself around until
       its prow points toward the sun. It advances with a gentle but gradually
       accelerated velocity, while the slight ripples it creates seem to break
       about the ivory side in divinest melody-seem to offer the only possible
       explanation of the soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin
       the bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.

       The canoe steadily proceeds, and the rocky gate of the vista is
       approached, so that its depths can be more distinctly seen. To the
       right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded. It is
       observed, however, that the trait of exquisite cleanness where the bank
       dips into the water, still prevails. There is not one token of the usual
       river debris. To the left the character of the scene is softer and more
       obviously artificial. Here the bank slopes upward from the stream in
       a very gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a texture
       resembling nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of green which
       would bear comparison with the tint of the purest emerald. This plateau
       varies in width from ten to three hundred yards; reaching from the
       river-bank to a wall, fifty feet high, which extends, in an infinity of
       curves, but following the general direction of the river, until lost in
       the distance to the westward. This wall is of one continuous rock, and
       has been formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of
       the stream’s southern bank, but no trace of the labor has been suffered
       to remain. The chiselled stone has the hue of ages, and is profusely
       overhung and overspread with the ivy, the coral honeysuckle, the
       eglantine, and the clematis. The uniformity of the top and bottom lines
       of the wall is fully relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height,
       growing singly or in small groups, both along the plateau and in the
       domain behind the wall, but in close proximity to it; so that frequent
       limbs (of the black walnut especially) reach over and dip their pendent
       extremities into the water. Farther back within the domain, the vision
       is impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage.

       These things are observed during the canoe’s gradual approach to what I
       have called the gate of the vista. On drawing nearer to this, however,
       its chasm-like appearance vanishes; a new outlet from the bay is
       discovered to the left--in which direction the wall is also seen to
       sweep, still following the general course of the stream. Down this new
       opening the eye cannot penetrate very far; for the stream, accompanied
       by the wall, still bends to the left, until both are swallowed up by the
       leaves.

       The boat, nevertheless, glides magically into the winding channel; and
       here the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that opposite
       the wall in the straight vista. Lofty hills, rising occasionally into
       mountains, and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance, still shut in
       the scene.

       Floating gently onward, but with a velocity slightly augmented, the
       voyager, after many short turns, finds his progress apparently barred by
       a gigantic gate or rather door of burnished gold, elaborately carved and
       fretted, and reflecting the direct rays of the now fast-sinking sun
       with an effulgence that seems to wreath the whole surrounding forest in
       flames. This gate is inserted in the lofty wall; which here appears to
       cross the river at right angles. In a few moments, however, it is seen
       that the main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive
       curve to the left, the wall following it as before, while a stream of
       considerable volume, diverging from the principal one, makes its way,
       with a slight ripple, under the door, and is thus hidden from sight.
       The canoe falls into the lesser channel and approaches the gate. Its
       ponderous wings are slowly and musically expanded. The boat glides
       between them, and commences a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatre
       entirely begirt with purple mountains, whose bases are laved by a
       gleaming river throughout the full extent of their circuit. Meantime
       the whole Paradise of Arnheim bursts upon the view. There is a gush
       of entrancing melody; there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet
       odor,--there is a dream-like intermingling to the eye of tall
       slender Eastern trees--bosky shrubberies--flocks of golden and crimson
       birds--lily-fringed lakes--meadows of violets, tulips, poppies,
       hyacinths, and tuberoses--long intertangled lines of silver
       streamlets--and, upspringing confusedly from amid all, a mass of
       semi-Gothic, semi-Saracenic architecture sustaining itself by miracle in
       mid-air, glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred oriels, minarets,
       and pinnacles; and seeming the phantom handiwork, conjointly, of the
       Sylphs, of the Fairies, of the Genii and of the Gnomes.




       LANDOR’S COTTAGE

            A Pendant to “The Domain of Arnheim”

       DURING A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river
       counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat
       embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated very
       remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about so
       confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew
       in what direction lay the sweet village of B----, where I had determined
       to stop for the night. The sun had scarcely shone--strictly
       speaking--during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantly
       warm. A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all
       things, and of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much
       about the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset,
       or even before dark, it was more than possible that a little
       Dutch farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its
       appearance--although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account of
       being more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely inhabited. At
       all events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, a
       bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me.
       I sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease--Ponto taking charge of my
       gun--until at length, just as I had begun to consider whether the
       numerous little glades that led hither and thither, were intended to
       be paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable
       carriage track. There could be no mistaking it. The traces of light
       wheels were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown
       undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever below, even
       to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon--the most aspiring vehicle,
       I take it, of its kind. The road, however, except in being open through
       the wood--if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of
       light trees--and except in the particulars of evident wheel-tracks--bore
       no resemblance to any road I had before seen. The tracks of which I
       speak were but faintly perceptible--having been impressed upon the firm,
       yet pleasantly moist surface of--what looked more like green Genoese
       velvet than any thing else. It was grass, clearly--but grass such as we
       seldom see out of England--so short, so thick, so even, and so vivid in
       color. Not a single impediment lay in the wheel-route--not even a chip
       or dead twig. The stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully
       placed--not thrown-along the sides of the lane, so as to define its
       boundaries at bottom with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and
       wholly picturesque definition. Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere,
       luxuriantly, in the interspaces.

       What to make of all this, of course I knew not. Here was art
       undoubtedly--that did not surprise me--all roads, in the ordinary sense,
       are works of art; nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in the
       mere excess of art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, might
       have been done here--with such natural “capabilities” (as they have
       it in the books on Landscape Gardening)--with very little labor and
       expense. No; it was not the amount but the character of the art which
       caused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and
       down this fairy-like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered
       admiration. One thing became more and more evident the longer I
       gazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form, had
       superintended all these arrangements. The greatest care had been taken
       to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand,
       and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the Italian term, on the
       other. There were few straight, and no long uninterrupted lines. The
       same effect of curvature or of color appeared twice, usually, but not
       oftener, at any one point of view. Everywhere was variety in uniformity.
       It was a piece of “composition,” in which the most fastidiously critical
       taste could scarcely have suggested an emendation.

       I had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now, arising, I
       continued in the same direction. The path was so serpentine, that at
       no moment could I trace its course for more than two or three paces in
       advance. Its character did not undergo any material change.

       Presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear--and in a few
       moments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than
       hitherto, I became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot
       of a gentle declivity just before me. I could see nothing distinctly on
       account of the mist which occupied all the little valley below. A gentle
       breeze, however, now arose, as the sun was about descending; and while
       I remained standing on the brow of the slope, the fog gradually became
       dissipated into wreaths, and so floated over the scene.

       As it came fully into view--thus gradually as I describe it--piece by
       piece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again the summit
       of a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one of
       the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of “vanishing
       pictures.”

       By the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared, the sun
       had made its way down behind the gentle hills, and thence, as if with
       a slight chassez to the south, had come again fully into sight, glaring
       with a purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the
       west. Suddenly, therefore--and as if by the hand of magic--this whole
       valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible.

       The first coup d’oeil, as the sun slid into the position described,
       impressed me very much as I have been impressed, when a boy, by
       the concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical spectacle or
       melodrama. Not even the monstrosity of color was wanting; for the
       sunlight came out through the chasm, tinted all orange and purple; while
       the vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or less
       upon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead,
       as if loth to take its total departure from a scene so enchantingly
       beautiful.

       The little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog canopy
       could not have been more than four hundred yards long; while in breadth
       it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred.
       It was most narrow at its northern extremity, opening out as it tended
       southwardly, but with no very precise regularity. The widest portion
       was within eighty yards of the southern extreme. The slopes which
       encompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills, unless at their
       northern face. Here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of
       some ninety feet; and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point was
       not more than fifty feet wide; but as the visiter proceeded southwardly
       from the cliff, he found on his right hand and on his left, declivities
       at once less high, less precipitous, and less rocky. All, in a word,
       sloped and softened to the south; and yet the whole vale was engirdled
       by eminences, more or less high, except at two points. One of these I
       have already spoken of. It lay considerably to the north of west, and
       was where the setting sun made its way, as I have before described, into
       the amphitheatre, through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite
       embankment; this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its widest
       point, so far as the eye could trace it. It seemed to lead up, up like a
       natural causeway, into the recesses of unexplored mountains and forests.
       The other opening was directly at the southern end of the vale. Here,
       generally, the slopes were nothing more than gentle inclinations,
       extending from east to west about one hundred and fifty yards. In the
       middle of this extent was a depression, level with the ordinary floor of
       the valley. As regards vegetation, as well as in respect to every thing
       else, the scene softened and sloped to the south. To the north--on the
       craggy precipice--a few paces from the verge--up sprang the magnificent
       trunks of numerous hickories, black walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed
       with occasional oak, and the strong lateral branches thrown out by the
       walnuts especially, spread far over the edge of the cliff. Proceeding
       southwardly, the explorer saw, at first, the same class of trees,
       but less and less lofty and Salvatorish in character; then he saw the
       gentler elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust--these again by the
       softer linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple--these yet again by still
       more graceful and more modest varieties. The whole face of the southern
       declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone--an occasional
       silver willow or white poplar excepted. In the bottom of the valley
       itself--(for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hitherto
       mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides)--were to be seen three
       insulated trees. One was an elm of fine size and exquisite form: it
       stood guard over the southern gate of the vale. Another was a hickory,
       much larger than the elm, and altogether a much finer tree, although
       both were exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge of the
       northwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the very jaws
       of the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an angle of nearly
       forty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre. About
       thirty yards east of this tree stood, however, the pride of the valley,
       and beyond all question the most magnificent tree I have ever seen,
       unless, perhaps, among the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. It was a
       triple-stemmed tulip-tree--the Liriodendron Tulipiferum--one of the
       natural order of magnolias. Its three trunks separated from the parent
       at about three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly and
       gradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where the
       largest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation of about
       eighty feet. The whole height of the principal division was one hundred
       and twenty feet. Nothing can surpass in beauty the form, or the glossy,
       vivid green of the leaves of the tulip-tree. In the present instance
       they were fully eight inches wide; but their glory was altogether
       eclipsed by the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms. Conceive,
       closely congregated, a million of the largest and most resplendent
       tulips! Only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture I would
       convey. And then the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulated
       columnar stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from the
       ground. The innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of other trees
       scarcely less beautiful, although infinitely less majestic, filled the
       valley with more than Arabian perfumes.

       The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as
       that I had found in the road; if anything, more deliciously soft, thick,
       velvety, and miraculously green. It was hard to conceive how all this
       beauty had been attained.

       I have spoken of two openings into the vale. From the one to the
       northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly
       foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks out
       of which sprang the insulated hickory. Here, after encircling the tree,
       it passed on a little to the north of east, leaving the tulip tree some
       twenty feet to the south, and making no decided alteration in its course
       until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries
       of the valley. At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at
       right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it
       went--until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (although
       roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale.
       This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widest
       part. No crystal could be clearer than its waters. Its bottom, which
       could be distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantly
       white. Its banks, of the emerald grass already described, rounded,
       rather than sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear was
       this heaven, so perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above
       it, that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced,
       it was a point of no little difficulty to determine. The trout, and
       some other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be almost
       inconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish.
       It was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely
       suspended in the air. A light birch canoe that lay placidly on the
       water, was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed
       by the most exquisitely polished mirror. A small island, fairly laughing
       with flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just
       enough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a fowl-house--arose
       from the lake not far from its northern shore--to which it was connected
       by means of an inconceivably light-looking and yet very primitive
       bridge. It was formed of a single, broad and thick plank of the tulip
       wood. This was forty feet long, and spanned the interval between shore
       and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch, preventing all
       oscillation. From the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation
       of the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards,
       finally passed through the “depression” (already described) in the
       middle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of
       a hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson.

       The lake was deep--at some points thirty feet--but the rivulet seldom
       exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight. Its bottom and
       banks were as those of the pond--if a defect could have been attributed,
       in point of picturesqueness, it was that of excessive neatness.

       The expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an
       occasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common snowball,
       or the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a clump of geraniums
       blossoming gorgeously in great varieties. These latter grew in pots
       which were carefully buried in the soil, so as to give the plants the
       appearance of being indigenous. Besides all this, the lawn’s velvet was
       exquisitely spotted with sheep--a considerable flock of which roamed
       about the vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of
       brilliantly-plumed ducks. A very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant
       attendance upon these animals, each and all.

       Along the eastern and western cliffs--where, toward the upper portion of
       the amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less precipitous--grew ivy
       in great profusion--so that only here and there could even a glimpse of
       the naked rock be obtained. The northern precipice, in like manner,
       was almost entirely clothed by grape-vines of rare luxuriance; some
       springing from the soil at the base of the cliff, and others from ledges
       on its face.

       The slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little
       domain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient height to
       prevent the escape of the deer. Nothing of the fence kind was observable
       elsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed:--any
       stray sheep, for example, which should attempt to make its way out of
       the vale by means of the ravine, would find its progress arrested,
       after a few yards’ advance, by the precipitous ledge of rock over which
       tumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as I first drew near
       the domain. In short, the only ingress or egress was through a gate
       occupying a rocky pass in the road, a few paces below the point at which
       I stopped to reconnoitre the scene.

       I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the
       whole of its course. Its two general directions, as I have said, were
       first from west to east, and then from north to south. At the turn, the
       stream, sweeping backward, made an almost circular loop, so as to form a
       peninsula which was very nearly an island, and which included about the
       sixteenth of an acre. On this peninsula stood a dwelling-house--and when
       I say that this house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek, “etait
       d’une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,” I mean,
       merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense of
       combined novelty and propriety--in a word, of poetry--(for, than in the
       words just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in the abstract,
       a more rigorous definition)--and I do not mean that merely outre was
       perceptible in any respect.

       In fact nothing could well be more simple--more utterly unpretending
       than this cottage. Its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic
       arrangement as a picture. I could have fancied, while I looked at it,
       that some eminent landscape-painter had built it with his brush.

       The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not altogether,
       although it was nearly, the best point from which to survey the house.
       I will therefore describe it as I afterwards saw it--from a position on
       the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre.

       The main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen
       broad--certainly not more. Its total height, from the ground to the apex
       of the roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet. To the west end
       of this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its
       proportions:--the line of its front standing back about two yards from
       that of the larger house, and the line of its roof, of course, being
       considerably depressed below that of the roof adjoining. At right angles
       to these buildings, and from the rear of the main one--not exactly in
       the middle--extended a third compartment, very small--being, in general,
       one-third less than the western wing. The roofs of the two larger were
       very steep--sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave curve,
       and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front, so as to
       form the roofs of two piazzas. These latter roofs, of course, needed
       no support; but as they had the air of needing it, slight and perfectly
       plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone. The roof of the
       northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof.
       Between the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and rather
       slender square chimney of hard Dutch bricks, alternately black and
       red:--a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top. Over the gables
       the roofs also projected very much:--in the main building about four
       feet to the east and two to the west. The principal door was not exactly
       in the main division, being a little to the east--while the two windows
       were to the west. These latter did not extend to the floor, but were
       much longer and narrower than usual--they had single shutters like
       doors--the panes were of lozenge form, but quite large. The door itself
       had its upper half of glass, also in lozenge panes--a movable shutter
       secured it at night. The door to the west wing was in its gable, and
       quite simple--a single window looked out to the south. There was no
       external door to the north wing, and it also had only one window to the
       east.

       The blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with a
       balustrade) running diagonally across it--the ascent being from the
       south. Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave access
       to a door leading to the garret, or rather loft--for it was lighted only
       by a single window to the north, and seemed to have been intended as a
       store-room.

       The piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors, as is
       usual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat irregular slabs
       of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf, affording comfortable
       footing in all weather. Excellent paths of the same material--not nicely
       adapted, but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between the
       stones, led hither and thither from the house, to a crystal spring about
       five paces off, to the road, or to one or two out-houses that lay to
       the north, beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a few
       locusts and catalpas.

       Not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the
       dead trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to foot in
       the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to
       determine what manner of sweet thing it could be. From various arms of
       this tree hung cages of different kinds. In one, a large wicker cylinder
       with a ring at top, revelled a mocking bird; in another an oriole; in a
       third the impudent bobolink--while three or four more delicate prisons
       were loudly vocal with canaries.

       The pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet
       honeysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure and
       its west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled luxuriance.
       Scorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the lower roof--then
       to the higher; and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writhe
       on, throwing out tendrils to the right and left, until at length it
       fairly attained the east gable, and fell trailing over the stairs.

       The whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the old-fashioned
       Dutch shingles--broad, and with unrounded corners. It is a peculiarity
       of this material to give houses built of it the appearance of being
       wider at bottom than at top--after the manner of Egyptian architecture;
       and in the present instance, this exceedingly picturesque effect was
       aided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the
       base of the buildings.

       The shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with which this
       neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves that
       partially overshadowed the cottage, can readily be conceived by an
       artist.

       From the position near the stone wall, as described, the buildings
       were seen at great advantage--for the southeastern angle was thrown
       forward--so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts,
       with the picturesque eastern gable, and at the same time obtained just a
       sufficient glimpse of the northern wing, with parts of a pretty roof
       to the spring-house, and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the
       brook in the near vicinity of the main buildings.

       I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long enough
       to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet. It was clear that
       I had wandered from the road to the village, and I had thus good
       traveller’s excuse to open the gate before me, and inquire my way, at
       all events; so, without more ado, I proceeded.

       The road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural ledge,
       sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern cliffs. It
       led me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and thence over the
       bridge, round by the eastern gable to the front door. In this progress,
       I took notice that no sight of the out-houses could be obtained.

       As I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards me in
       stern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger. I held him
       out my hand, however, in token of amity--and I never yet knew the dog
       who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy. He not only
       shut his mouth and wagged his tail, but absolutely offered me his
       paw--afterward extending his civilities to Ponto.

       As no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against the
       door, which stood half open. Instantly a figure advanced to the
       threshold--that of a young woman about twenty-eight years of
       age--slender, or rather slight, and somewhat above the medium height.
       As she approached, with a certain modest decision of step altogether
       indescribable. I said to myself, “Surely here I have found the
       perfection of natural, in contradistinction from artificial grace.” The
       second impression which she made on me, but by far the more vivid of
       the two, was that of enthusiasm. So intense an expression of romance,
       perhaps I should call it, or of unworldliness, as that which gleamed
       from her deep-set eyes, had never so sunk into my heart of hearts
       before. I know not how it is, but this peculiar expression of the eye,
       wreathing itself occasionally into the lips, is the most powerful,
       if not absolutely the sole spell, which rivets my interest in woman.
       “Romance,” provided my readers fully comprehended what I would here imply
       by the word--“romance” and “womanliness” seem to me convertible terms:
       and, after all, what man truly loves in woman, is simply her womanhood.
       The eyes of Annie (I heard some one from the interior call her “Annie,
       darling!”) were “spiritual grey;” her hair, a light chestnut: this is
       all I had time to observe of her.

       At her most courteous of invitations, I entered--passing first into a
       tolerably wide vestibule. Having come mainly to observe, I took notice
       that to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such as those in front
       of the house; to the left, a door leading into the principal room;
       while, opposite me, an open door enabled me to see a small apartment,
       just the size of the vestibule, arranged as a study, and having a large
       bow window looking out to the north.

       Passing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor--for this,
       I afterwards found, was his name. He was civil, even cordial in his
       manner, but just then, I was more intent on observing the arrangements
       of the dwelling which had so much interested me, than the personal
       appearance of the tenant.

       The north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened into the
       parlor. West of this door was a single window, looking toward the brook.
       At the west end of the parlor, were a fireplace, and a door leading into
       the west wing--probably a kitchen.

       Nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the
       parlor. On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent texture--a
       white ground, spotted with small circular green figures. At the windows
       were curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin: they were tolerably full,
       and hung decisively, perhaps rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits
       to the floor--just to the floor. The walls were prepared with a French
       paper of great delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord
       running zig-zag throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by three
       of Julien’s exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the wall
       without frames. One of these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury, or
       rather voluptuousness; another was a “carnival piece,” spirited
       beyond compare; the third was a Greek female head--a face so divinely
       beautiful, and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate, never
       before arrested my attention.

       The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few chairs
       (including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather “settee;” its
       material was plain maple painted a creamy white, slightly interstriped
       with green; the seat of cane. The chairs and table were “to match,” but
       the forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain which
       planned “the grounds;” it is impossible to conceive anything more
       graceful.

       On the table were a few books, a large, square, crystal bottle of some
       novel perfume, a plain ground-glass astral (not solar) lamp with an
       Italian shade, and a large vase of resplendently-blooming flowers.
       Flowers, indeed, of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole
       mere decoration of the apartment. The fire-place was nearly filled with
       a vase of brilliant geranium. On a triangular shelf in each angle of the
       room stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely contents.
       One or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and late violets
       clustered about the open windows.

       It is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail, a
       picture of Mr. Landor’s residence--as I found it. How he made it what it
       was--and why--with some particulars of Mr. Landor himself--may, possibly
       form the subject of another article.




       WILLIAM WILSON

           What say of it? what say of CONSCIENCE grim,
           That spectre in my path?

                          _Chamberlayne’s Pharronida._

       LET me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair page now
       lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. This has
       been already too much an object for the scorn--for the horror--for the
       detestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have not
       the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of all
       outcasts most abandoned!--to the earth art thou not forever dead? to its
       honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?--and a cloud, dense,
       dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and
       heaven?

       I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later
       years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This epoch--these
       later years--took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude, whose
       origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow base
       by degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a
       mantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the stride
       of a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What
       chance--what one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me
       while I relate. Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has
       thrown a softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through
       the dim valley, for the sympathy--I had nearly said for the pity--of
       my fellow men. I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some
       measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control. I would wish
       them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some
       little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error. I would have them
       allow--what they cannot refrain from allowing--that, although temptation
       may have erewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least,
       tempted before--certainly, never thus fell. And is it therefore that he
       has never thus suffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And
       am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest
       of all sublunary visions?

       I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable
       temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my
       earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family
       character. As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed;
       becoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my
       friends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed, addicted
       to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions.
       Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own,
       my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which
       distinguished me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in
       complete failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on
       mine. Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when
       few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to the
       guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my
       own actions.

       My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a large,
       rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England,
       where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all
       the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like
       and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, in
       fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues,
       inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew
       with undefinable delight, at the deep hollow note of the church-bell,
       breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of
       the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded
       and asleep.

       It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner
       experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its
       concerns. Steeped in misery as I am--misery, alas! only too real--I
       shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary,
       in the weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly
       trivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy,
       adventitious importance, as connected with a period and a locality when
       and where I recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which
       afterwards so fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.

       The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were
       extensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar
       and broken glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like rampart formed
       the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week--once every
       Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to
       take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields--and
       twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to
       the morning and evening service in the one church of the village. Of
       this church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a
       spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote
       pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the
       pulpit! This reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign,
       with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely
       powdered, so rigid and so vast,---could this be he who, of late, with
       sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand,
       the Draconian laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly
       monstrous for solution!

       At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It was
       riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron
       spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It was never
       opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already
       mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found a
       plenitude of mystery--a world of matter for solemn remark, or for more
       solemn meditation.

       The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious
       recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the
       play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well
       remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within
       it. Of course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small
       parterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred
       division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed--such as a first
       advent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent
       or friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the
       Christmas or Midsummer holy-days.

       But the house!--how quaint an old building was this!--to me how
       veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its
       windings--to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, at
       any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories
       one happened to be. From each room to every other there were sure to be
       found three or four steps either in ascent or descent. Then the lateral
       branches were innumerable--inconceivable--and so returning in upon
       themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion
       were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon
       infinity. During the five years of my residence here, I was never able
       to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the little
       sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other
       scholars.

       The school-room was the largest in the house--I could not help thinking,
       in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointed
       Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and terror-inspiring
       angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the
       sanctum, “during hours,” of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It
       was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which in the
       absence of the “Dominic,” we would all have willingly perished by the
       peine forte et dure. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far
       less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of
       these was the pulpit of the “classical” usher, one of the “English and
       mathematical.” Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing
       in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black,
       ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books,
       and so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque
       figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely
       lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days
       long departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the
       room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.

       Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed, yet
       not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life.
       The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to
       occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was
       replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived
       from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my
       first mental development had in it much of the uncommon--even much of
       the outre. Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence
       rarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All is gray
       shadow--a weak and irregular remembrance--an indistinct regathering of
       feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. In
       childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find
       stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the
       exergues of the Carthaginian medals.

       Yet in fact--in the fact of the world’s view--how little was there
       to remember! The morning’s awakening, the nightly summons to bed;
       the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and
       perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its
       intrigues;--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to
       involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an
       universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and
       spirit-stirring. “Oh, le bon temps, que ce siecle de fer!”

       In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my
       disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates,
       and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendancy over all
       not greatly older than myself;--over all with a single exception.
       This exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, although
       no relation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself;--a
       circumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble
       descent, mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem, by
       prescriptive right, to have been, time out of mind, the common property
       of the mob. In this narrative I have therefore designated myself as
       William Wilson,--a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real.
       My namesake alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted “our
       set,” presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class--in the
       sports and broils of the play-ground--to refuse implicit belief in my
       assertions, and submission to my will--indeed, to interfere with my
       arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there is on earth a
       supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master mind
       in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.

       Wilson’s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest
       embarrassment;--the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in
       public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly
       felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the equality which
       he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority;
       since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet this
       superiority--even this equality--was in truth acknowledged by no one but
       myself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even
       to suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially
       his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not more
       pointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition
       which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to
       excel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a
       whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself; although there
       were times when I could not help observing, with a feeling made up of
       wonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his
       insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and
       assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner. I could only
       conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate self-conceit
       assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.

       Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson’s conduct, conjoined with our
       identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the school
       upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers,
       among the senior classes in the academy. These do not usually inquire
       with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have before
       said, or should have said, that Wilson was not, in the most remote
       degree, connected with my family. But assuredly if we had been brothers
       we must have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby’s, I casually
       learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January,
       1813--and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is
       precisely that of my own nativity.

       It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me
       by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction,
       I could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We had, to be sure,
       nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm of
       victory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he
       who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable
       dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are called “speaking
       terms,” while there were many points of strong congeniality in our
       tempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone,
       perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. It is difficult,
       indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real feelings towards
       him. They formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture;--some petulant
       animosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, more respect, much
       fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. To the moralist it will be
       unnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself were the most
       inseparable of companions.

       It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us,
       which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open
       or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain
       while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious
       and determined hostility. But my endeavours on this head were by no
       means uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily
       concocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that
       unassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of
       its own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses
       to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point,
       and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from
       constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less
       at his wit’s end than myself;--my rival had a weakness in the faucal or
       guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any time
       above a very low whisper. Of this defect I did not fail to take what
       poor advantage lay in my power.

       Wilson’s retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his
       practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his sagacity first
       discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a question I
       never could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised the
       annoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and
       its very common, if not plebeian praenomen. The words were venom in my
       ears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came
       also to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and
       doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would
       be the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my
       presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school
       business, must inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be
       often confounded with my own.

       The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every
       circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my
       rival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we
       were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and
       I perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of
       person and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching
       a relationship, which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word,
       nothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously
       concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind,
       person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no reason
       to believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and
       in the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had ever been made a
       subject of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows. That
       he observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent;
       but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of
       annoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than
       ordinary penetration.

       His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words
       and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My dress it
       was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were, without
       difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my
       voice did not escape him. My louder tones were, of course, unattempted,
       but then the key, it was identical; and his singular whisper, it grew
       the very echo of my own.

       How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it could
       not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe.
       I had but one consolation--in the fact that the imitation, apparently,
       was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing
       and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with
       having produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle
       in secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically
       disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty
       endeavours might have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did
       not feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in
       his sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not
       resolve. Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily
       perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the master air of
       the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, (which in a painting is all
       the obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit of his original for my
       individual contemplation and chagrin.

       I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage
       which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious interference
       with my will. This interference often took the ungracious character of
       advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received it
       with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this
       distant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can
       recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side
       of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming
       inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents
       and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might,
       to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less
       frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers
       which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised.

       As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful
       supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I considered
       his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in the first years of our
       connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him might have
       been easily ripened into friendship: but, in the latter months of my
       residence at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner
       had, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly
       similar proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one
       occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show of
       avoiding me.

       It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an
       altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually
       thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor
       rather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered,
       in his accent, his air, and general appearance, a something which first
       startled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions
       of my earliest infancy--wild, confused and thronging memories of a
       time when memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe the
       sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with difficulty
       shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who
       stood before me, at some epoch very long ago--some point of the past
       even infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came;
       and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation I
       there held with my singular namesake.

       The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several large
       chambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number
       of the students. There were, however, (as must necessarily happen in a
       building so awkwardly planned,) many little nooks or recesses, the
       odds and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr.
       Bransby had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest
       closets, they were capable of accommodating but a single individual. One
       of these small apartments was occupied by Wilson.

       One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and
       immediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one
       wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a
       wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival. I
       had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit
       at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful.
       It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved
       to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued.
       Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with
       a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step, and listened to
       the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of his being asleep, I
       returned, took the light, and with it again approached the bed. Close
       curtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I
       slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon
       the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance. I
       looked;--and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my
       frame. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit became
       possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping for
       breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were
       these--these the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they
       were his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they
       were not. What was there about them to confound me in this manner? I
       gazed;--while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts.
       Not thus he appeared--assuredly not thus--in the vivacity of his waking
       hours. The same name! the same contour of person! the same day of
       arrival at the academy! And then his dogged and meaningless imitation
       of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was it, in truth, within
       the bounds of human possibility, that what I now saw was the result,
       merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation?
       Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp,
       passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that
       old academy, never to enter them again.

       After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found
       myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient to
       enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby’s, or at least
       to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which
       I remembered them. The truth--the tragedy--of the drama was no more.
       I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom
       called up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human
       credulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I
       hereditarily possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely to
       be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex of
       thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly
       plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at
       once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only the
       veriest levities of a former existence.

       I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy
       here--a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded
       the vigilance of the institution. Three years of folly, passed without
       profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat
       unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless
       dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a
       secret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night; for
       our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. The
       wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps more
       dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared
       in the east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height. Madly
       flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon
       a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly
       diverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the
       apartment, and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He said
       that some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me
       in the hall.

       Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted
       than surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought
       me to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small room there
       hung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the
       exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semi-circular
       window. As I put my foot over the threshold, I became aware of the
       figure of a youth about my own height, and habited in a white kerseymere
       morning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the
       moment. This the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of
       his face I could not distinguish. Upon my entering he strode hurriedly
       up to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant
       impatience, whispered the words “William Wilson!” in my ear.

       I grew perfectly sober in an instant. There was that in the manner of
       the stranger, and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he
       held it between my eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified
       amazement; but it was not this which had so violently moved me. It
       was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissing
       utterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the key, of
       those few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered syllables, which came
       with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days, and struck upon my
       soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could recover the use
       of my senses he was gone.

       Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered
       imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I
       busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid
       speculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the
       identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered
       with my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. But
       who and what was this Wilson?--and whence came he?--and what were his
       purposes? Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely
       ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family had
       caused his removal from Dr. Bransby’s academy on the afternoon of the
       day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased
       to think upon the subject; my attention being all absorbed in
       a contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon went; the
       uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and
       annual establishment, which would enable me to indulge at will in
       the luxury already so dear to my heart,--to vie in profuseness of
       expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in
       Great Britain.

       Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke
       forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of
       decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were absurd to
       pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that among
       spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude
       of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of
       vices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.

       It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly
       fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance with the
       vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept
       in his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of
       increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded
       among my fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the
       very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment
       proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason of the impunity
       with which it was committed. Who, indeed, among my most abandoned
       associates, would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his
       senses, than have suspected of such courses, the gay, the frank, the
       generous William Wilson--the noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford--him
       whose follies (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and
       unbridled fancy--whose errors but inimitable whim--whose darkest vice
       but a careless and dashing extravagance?

       I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there
       came to the university a young parvenu nobleman, Glendinning--rich, said
       report, as Herodes Atticus--his riches, too, as easily acquired. I soon
       found him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting
       subject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived,
       with the gambler’s usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more
       effectually to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes being
       ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be
       final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,)
       equally intimate with both, but who, to do him Justice, entertained
       not even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a better
       colouring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or
       ten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should
       appear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated
       dupe himself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was
       omitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter
       for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.

       We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length
       effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist. The
       game, too, was my favorite ecarte! The rest of the company, interested
       in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were
       standing around us as spectators. The parvenu, who had been induced
       by my artifices in the early part of the evening, to drink deeply, now
       shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which
       his intoxication, I thought, might partially, but could not altogether
       account. In a very short period he had become my debtor to a large
       amount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely
       what I had been coolly anticipating--he proposed to double our already
       extravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not
       until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words
       which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply. The
       result, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils;
       in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt. For some time his
       countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine; but
       now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly
       fearful. I say to my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented to
       my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had
       as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very
       seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcome
       by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented
       itself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character
       in the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I
       was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play,
       when some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an
       ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me
       to understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances
       which, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have
       protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.

       What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The pitiable
       condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all;
       and, for some moments, a profound silence was maintained, during which I
       could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances
       of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party.
       I will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a
       brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary
       interruption which ensued. The wide, heavy folding doors of the
       apartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a
       vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic,
       every candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just to
       perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and closely
       muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total; and we could
       only feel that he was standing in our midst. Before any one of us could
       recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had
       thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.

       “Gentlemen,” he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten
       whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, “Gentlemen, I
       make no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving, I am
       but fulfilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true
       character of the person who has to-night won at ecarte a large sum
       of money from Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an
       expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary
       information. Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of
       the cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may
       be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning
       wrapper.”

       While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard
       a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once, and as
       abruptly as he had entered. Can I--shall I describe my sensations?--must
       I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I had
       little time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the
       spot, and lights were immediately reprocured. A search ensued. In the
       lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in ecarte,
       and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of
       those used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of
       the species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightly
       convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In
       this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the
       pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while
       the gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for
       his victim which may count in the records of the game.

       Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less
       than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which it was
       received.

       “Mr. Wilson,” said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet
       an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, “Mr. Wilson, this is your
       property.” (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had
       thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching
       the scene of play.) “I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeing
       the folds of the garment with a bitter smile) for any farther evidence
       of your skill. Indeed, we have had enough. You will see the necessity,
       I hope, of quitting Oxford--at all events, of quitting instantly my
       chambers.”

       Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should
       have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had
       not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the
       most startling character. The cloak which I had worn was of a rare
       description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not
       venture to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; for
       I was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this
       frivolous nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which
       he had picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the
       apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror,
       that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt
       unwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented me was but its exact
       counterpart in every, in even the minutest possible particular. The
       singular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled,
       I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of
       the members of our party with the exception of myself. Retaining some
       presence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston; placed it,
       unnoticed, over my own; left the apartment with a resolute scowl of
       defiance; and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey
       from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.

       I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and
       proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet
       only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had fresh evidence of
       the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns. Years flew,
       while I experienced no relief. Villain!--at Rome, with how untimely,
       yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between me and my
       ambition! At Vienna, too--at Berlin--and at Moscow! Where, in truth, had
       I not bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his inscrutable
       tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; and
       to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.

       And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would
       I demand the questions “Who is he?--whence came he?--and what are his
       objects?” But no answer was there found. And then I scrutinized, with a
       minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of
       his impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little upon
       which to base a conjecture. It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one
       of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had
       he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those
       actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter
       mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so
       imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so
       pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!

       I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long
       period of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity
       maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) had so
       contrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my will,
       that I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face. Be Wilson what
       he might, this, at least, was but the veriest of affectation, or of
       folly. Could he, for an instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher
       at Eton--in the destroyer of my honor at Oxford,--in him who thwarted my
       ambition at Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or
       what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt,--that in this, my arch-enemy
       and evil genius, could fail to recognise the William Wilson of my
       school boy days,--the namesake, the companion, the rival,--the hated and
       dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby’s? Impossible!--But let me hasten to the
       last eventful scene of the drama.

       Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination. The
       sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated
       character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and
       omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which
       certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had
       operated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness
       and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterly
       reluctant submission to his arbitrary will. But, of late days, I had
       given myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my
       hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. I
       began to murmur,--to hesitate,--to resist. And was it only fancy which
       induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that
       of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution? Be this as it may,
       I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at length
       nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that I
       would submit no longer to be enslaved.

       It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18--, that I attended a
       masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had
       indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and
       now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond
       endurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of
       the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for
       I was anxiously seeking, (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the
       young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio.
       With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me
       the secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having
       caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her
       presence.--At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder,
       and that ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my ear.

       In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus
       interrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar. He was attired,
       as I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own; wearing a
       Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a crimson belt
       sustaining a rapier. A mask of black silk entirely covered his face.

       “Scoundrel!” I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable
       I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, “scoundrel! impostor! accursed
       villain! you shall not--you shall not dog me unto death! Follow me, or I
       stab you where you stand!”--and I broke my way from the ball-room into
       a small ante-chamber adjoining--dragging him unresistingly with me as I
       went.

       Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against the
       wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw.
       He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in
       silence, and put himself upon his defence.

       The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild
       excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a
       multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the
       wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with
       brute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.

       At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened
       to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying
       antagonist. But what human language can adequately portray that
       astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then
       presented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been
       sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangements
       at the upper or farther end of the room. A large mirror,--so at first it
       seemed to me in my confusion--now stood where none had been perceptible
       before; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own
       image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meet
       me with a feeble and tottering gait.

       Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist--it was
       Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution.
       His mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor. Not
       a thread in all his raiment--not a line in all the marked and singular
       lineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absolute
       identity, mine own!

       It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have
       fancied that I myself was speaking while he said:

       “You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also
       dead--dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst thou
       exist--and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how
       utterly thou hast murdered thyself.”




       THE TELL-TALE HEART.

       TRUE!--nervous--very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but
       why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses--not
       destroyed--not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I
       heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things
       in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily--how
       calmly I can tell you the whole story.

       It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once
       conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion
       there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had
       never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his
       eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture--a pale blue eye,
       with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and
       so by degrees--very gradually--I made up my mind to take the life of the
       old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.

       Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you
       should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded--with
       what caution--with what foresight--with what dissimulation I went to
       work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week
       before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch
       of his door and opened it--oh so gently! And then, when I had made an
       opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed,
       closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh,
       you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it
       slowly--very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s
       sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so
       far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have
       been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I
       undid the lantern cautiously--oh, so cautiously--cautiously (for the
       hinges creaked)--I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell
       upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights--every night
       just at midnight--but I found the eye always closed; and so it was
       impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but
       his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into
       the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a
       hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he
       would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every
       night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.

       Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the
       door. A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never
       before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers--of my
       sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think
       that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to
       dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and
       perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled.
       Now you may think that I drew back--but no. His room was as black as
       pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened,
       through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the
       opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.

       I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb
       slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying
       out--“Who’s there?”

       I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a
       muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still
       sitting up in the bed listening;--just as I have done, night after
       night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.

       Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal
       terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief--oh, no!--it was the low
       stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged
       with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when
       all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with
       its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well.
       I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at
       heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight
       noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since
       growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could
       not. He had been saying to himself--“It is nothing but the wind in the
       chimney--it is only a mouse crossing the floor,” or “It is merely a
       cricket which has made a single chirp.” Yes, he had been trying to
       comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain.
       All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his
       black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the
       mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to
       feel--although he neither saw nor heard--to feel the presence of my head
       within the room.

       When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie
       down, I resolved to open a little--a very, very little crevice in
       the lantern. So I opened it--you cannot imagine how stealthily,
       stealthily--until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the
       spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.

       It was open--wide, wide open--and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I
       saw it with perfect distinctness--all a dull blue, with a hideous
       veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see
       nothing else of the old man’s face or person: for I had directed the ray
       as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.

       And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but
       over-acuteness of the sense?--now, I say, there came to my ears a low,
       dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I
       knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It
       increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into
       courage.

       But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the
       lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon
       the eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew
       quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man’s
       terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every
       moment!--do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am.
       And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of
       that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable
       terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But
       the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now
       a new anxiety seized me--the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The
       old man’s hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern
       and leaped into the room. He shrieked once--once only. In an instant
       I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then
       smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the
       heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it
       would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man
       was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone,
       stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many
       minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would
       trouble me no more.

       If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe
       the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night
       waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered
       the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.

       I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and
       deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so
       cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye--not even his--could have
       detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out--no stain of any
       kind--no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had
       caught all--ha! ha!

       When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o’clock--still dark
       as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the
       street door. I went down to open it with a light heart,--for what had
       I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with
       perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by
       a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused;
       information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the
       officers) had been deputed to search the premises.

       I smiled,--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The
       shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was
       absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade
       them search--search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I
       showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of
       my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here
       to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of
       my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which
       reposed the corpse of the victim.

       The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was
       singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they
       chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale
       and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my
       ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more
       distinct:--It continued and became more distinct: I talked more
       freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained
       definiteness--until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my
       ears.

       No doubt I now grew _very_ pale;--but I talked more fluently, and with a
       heightened voice. Yet the sound increased--and what could I do? It was
       a low, dull, quick sound--much such a sound as a watch makes when
       enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath--and yet the officers heard
       it not. I talked more quickly--more vehemently; but the noise steadily
       increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with
       violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would
       they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if
       excited to fury by the observations of the men--but the noise steadily
       increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed--I raved--I swore! I swung
       the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the
       boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It
       grew louder--louder--louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and
       smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!--no, no! They
       heard!--they suspected!--they knew!--they were making a mockery of my
       horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than
       this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear
       those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die!
       and now--again!--hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!

       “Villains!” I shrieked, “dissemble no more! I admit the deed!--tear up
       the planks! here, here!--It is the beating of his hideous heart!”




       BERENICE

            Dicebant mihi sodales, si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas
            meas aliquantulum forelevatas.

                                        --_Ebn Zaiat_.

       MISERY is manifold. The wretchedness of earth is multiform. Overreaching
       the wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as various as the hues of
       that arch--as distinct too, yet as intimately blended. Overreaching the
       wide horizon as the rainbow! How is it that from beauty I have derived
       a type of unloveliness?--from the covenant of peace, a simile of sorrow?
       But as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of
       joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of
       to-day, or the agonies which _are_, have their origin in the ecstasies
       which _might have been_.

       My baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not mention. Yet
       there are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy, gray,
       hereditary halls. Our line has been called a race of visionaries; and
       in many striking particulars--in the character of the family
       mansion--in the frescos of the chief saloon--in the tapestries of the
       dormitories--in the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory--but
       more especially in the gallery of antique paintings--in the fashion of
       the library chamber--and, lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the
       library’s contents--there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant
       the belief.

       The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber,
       and with its volumes--of which latter I will say no more. Here died my
       mother. Herein was I born. But it is mere idleness to say that I had not
       lived before--that the soul has no previous existence. You deny it?--let
       us not argue the matter. Convinced myself, I seek not to convince. There
       is, however, a remembrance of aerial forms--of spiritual and meaning
       eyes--of sounds, musical yet sad--a remembrance which will not be
       excluded; a memory like a shadow--vague, variable, indefinite, unsteady;
       and like a shadow, too, in the impossibility of my getting rid of it
       while the sunlight of my reason shall exist.

       In that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from the long night of what
       seemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very regions of fairy
       land--into a palace of imagination--into the wild dominions of monastic
       thought and erudition--it is not singular that I gazed around me with a
       startled and ardent eye--that I loitered away my boyhood in books,
       and dissipated my youth in reverie; but it _is_ singular that as years
       rolled away, and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my
       fathers--it _is_ wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs
       of my life--wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character
       of my commonest thought. The realities of the world affected me as
       visions, and as visions only, while the wild ideas of the land of dreams
       became, in turn, not the material of my every-day existence, but in very
       deed that existence utterly and solely in itself.

       * * * * *

       Berenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my paternal
       halls. Yet differently we grew--I, ill of health, and buried in
       gloom--she, agile, graceful, and overflowing with energy; hers, the
       ramble on the hill-side--mine the studies of the cloister; I, living
       within my own heart, and addicted, body and soul, to the most intense
       and painful meditation--she, roaming carelessly through life, with
       no thought of the shadows in her path, or the silent flight of the
       raven-winged hours. Berenice!--I call upon her name--Berenice!--and
       from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are
       startled at the sound! Ah, vividly is her image before me now, as in the
       early days of her light-heartedness and joy! Oh, gorgeous yet fantastic
       beauty! Oh, sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim! Oh, Naiad among its
       fountains! And then--then all is mystery and terror, and a tale which
       should not be told. Disease--a fatal disease, fell like the simoon upon
       her frame; and, even while I gazed upon her, the spirit of change swept
       over her, pervading her mind, her habits, and her character, and, in a
       manner the most subtle and terrible, disturbing even the identity of
       her person! Alas! the destroyer came and went!--and the victim--where is
       she? I knew her not--or knew her no longer as Berenice.

       Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and
       primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the
       moral and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as the most
       distressing and obstinate in its nature, a species of epilepsy not
       unfrequently terminating in _trance_ itself--trance very nearly
       resembling positive dissolution, and from which her manner of recovery
       was in most instances, startlingly abrupt. In the mean time my own
       disease--for I have been told that I should call it by no other
       appellation--my own disease, then, grew rapidly upon me, and assumed
       finally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary form--hourly
       and momently gaining vigor--and at length obtaining over me the most
       incomprehensible ascendancy. This monomania, if I must so term it,
       consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in
       metaphysical science termed the _attentive_. It is more than probable
       that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is in no manner
       possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader, an adequate
       idea of that nervous _intensity of interest_ with which, in my case,
       the powers of meditation (not to speak technically) busied and buried
       themselves, in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of
       the universe.

       To muse for long unwearied hours, with my attention riveted to some
       frivolous device on the margin, or in the typography of a book; to
       become absorbed, for the better part of a summer’s day, in a quaint
       shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor; to lose
       myself, for an entire night, in watching the steady flame of a lamp,
       or the embers of a fire; to dream away whole days over the perfume of a
       flower; to repeat, monotonously, some common word, until the sound, by
       dint of frequent repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the
       mind; to lose all sense of motion or physical existence, by means of
       absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in: such
       were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a
       condition of the mental faculties, not, indeed, altogether unparalleled,
       but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.

       Yet let me not be misapprehended. The undue, earnest, and morbid
       attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous, must
       not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common
       to all mankind, and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent
       imagination. It was not even, as might be at first supposed, an extreme
       condition, or exaggeration of such propensity, but primarily and
       essentially distinct and different. In the one instance, the dreamer,
       or enthusiast, being interested by an object usually _not_ frivolous,
       imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions
       and suggestions issuing therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a day
       dream _often replete with luxury_, he finds the _incitamentum_, or first
       cause of his musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case, the
       primary object was _invariably frivolous_, although assuming, through
       the medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and unreal importance.
       Few deductions, if any, were made; and those few pertinaciously
       returning in upon the original object as a centre. The meditations were
       _never_ pleasurable; and, at the termination of the reverie, the first
       cause, so far from being out of sight, had attained that supernaturally
       exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease. In
       a word, the powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with me, as
       I have said before, the _attentive_, and are, with the day-dreamer, the
       _speculative_.

       My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to irritate the
       disorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in their imaginative
       and inconsequential nature, of the characteristic qualities of the
       disorder itself. I well remember, among others, the treatise of the
       noble Italian, Coelius Secundus Curio, “_De Amplitudine Beati Regni
       Dei;_” St. Austin’s great work, the “City of God;” and Tertullian’s “_De
       Carne Christi_,” in which the paradoxical sentence “_Mortuus est Dei
       filius; credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certum
       est quia impossibile est,_” occupied my undivided time, for many weeks
       of laborious and fruitless investigation.

       Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivial
       things, my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of by
       Ptolemy Hephestion, which steadily resisting the attacks of human
       violence, and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds, trembled
       only to the touch of the flower called Asphodel. And although, to
       a careless thinker, it might appear a matter beyond doubt, that the
       alteration produced by her unhappy malady, in the _moral_ condition of
       Berenice, would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense
       and abnormal meditation whose nature I have been at some trouble in
       explaining, yet such was not in any degree the case. In the lucid
       intervals of my infirmity, her calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and,
       taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life, I
       did not fail to ponder, frequently and bitterly, upon the wonder-working
       means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought
       to pass. But these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of
       my disease, and were such as would have occurred, under similar
       circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind. True to its own
       character, my disorder revelled in the less important but more startling
       changes wrought in the _physical_ frame of Berenice--in the singular and
       most appalling distortion of her personal identity.

       During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely I had
       never loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence, feelings with
       me, _had never been_ of the heart, and my passions _always were_ of the
       mind. Through the gray of the early morning--among the trellised shadows
       of the forest at noonday--and in the silence of my library at night--she
       had flitted by my eyes, and I had seen her--not as the living and
       breathing Berenice, but as the Berenice of a dream; not as a being of
       the earth, earthy, but as the abstraction of such a being; not as a
       thing to admire, but to analyze; not as an object of love, but as
       the theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation. And
       _now_--now I shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach;
       yet, bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition, I called to
       mind that she had loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke to her
       of marriage.

       And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when, upon
       an afternoon in the winter of the year--one of those unseasonably
       warm, calm, and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon
       (*1),--I sat, (and sat, as I thought, alone,) in the inner apartment of
       the library. But, uplifting my eyes, I saw that Berenice stood before
       me.

       Was it my own excited imagination--or the misty influence of the
       atmosphere--or the uncertain twilight of the chamber--or the gray
       draperies which fell around her figure--that caused in it so vacillating
       and indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She spoke no word; and
       I--not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable. An icy chill ran
       through my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me; a
       consuming curiosity pervaded my soul; and sinking back upon the chair,
       I remained for some time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted
       upon her person. Alas! its emaciation was excessive, and not one vestige
       of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour. My burning
       glances at length fell upon the face.

       The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and the
       once jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the hollow
       temples with innumerable ringlets, now of a vivid yellow, and jarring
       discordantly, in their fantastic character, with the reigning melancholy
       of the countenance. The eyes were lifeless, and lustreless, and
       seemingly pupilless, and I shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare
       to the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips. They parted; and in a
       smile of peculiar meaning, _the teeth_ of the changed Berenice disclosed
       themselves slowly to my view. Would to God that I had never beheld them,
       or that, having done so, I had died!

       * * * * *

       The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found that my
       cousin had departed from the chamber. But from the disordered chamber
       of my brain, had not, alas! departed, and would not be driven away,
       the white and ghastly _spectrum_ of the teeth. Not a speck on their
       surface--not a shade on their enamel--not an indenture in their
       edges--but what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon
       my memory. I saw them _now_ even more unequivocally than I beheld
       them _then_. The teeth!--the teeth!--they were here, and there, and
       everywhere, and visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, and
       excessively white, with the pale lips writhing about them, as in the
       very moment of their first terrible development. Then came the full
       fury of my _monomania_, and I struggled in vain against its strange and
       irresistible influence. In the multiplied objects of the external world
       I had no thoughts but for the teeth. For these I longed with a phrenzied
       desire. All other matters and all different interests became absorbed in
       their single contemplation. They--they alone were present to the mental
       eye, and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of
       my mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every
       attitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their
       peculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon the
       alteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them in
       imagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when unassisted by
       the lips, a capability of moral expression. Of Mademoiselle Salle it
       has been well said, “_Que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments_,” and
       of Berenice I more seriously believed _que toutes ses dents etaient des
       idees_. _Des idees!_--ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me!
       _Des idees!_--ah _therefore_ it was that I coveted them so madly! I felt
       that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace, in giving me
       back to reason.

       And the evening closed in upon me thus--and then the darkness came, and
       tarried, and went--and the day again dawned--and the mists of a second
       night were now gathering around--and still I sat motionless in that
       solitary room--and still I sat buried in meditation--and still the
       _phantasma_ of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy, as, with
       the most vivid hideous distinctness, it floated about amid the changing
       lights and shadows of the chamber. At length there broke in upon my
       dreams a cry as of horror and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause,
       succeeded the sound of troubled voices, intermingled with many low
       moanings of sorrow or of pain. I arose from my seat, and throwing open
       one of the doors of the library, saw standing out in the ante-chamber
       a servant maiden, all in tears, who told me that Berenice was--no more!
       She had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning, and now, at the
       closing in of the night, the grave was ready for its tenant, and all the
       preparations for the burial were completed.

       * * * * *

       I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there alone. It
       seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream.
       I knew that it was now midnight, and I was well aware, that since the
       setting of the sun, Berenice had been interred. But of that dreary
       period which intervened I had no positive, at least no definite
       comprehension. Yet its memory was replete with horror--horror more
       horrible from being vague, and terror more terrible from ambiguity. It
       was a fearful page in the record my existence, written all over with
       dim, and hideous, and unintelligible recollections. I strived to
       decypher them, but in vain; while ever and anon, like the spirit of a
       departed sound, the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed
       to be ringing in my ears. I had done a deed--what was it? I asked myself
       the question aloud, and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered
       me,--“_what was it?_”

       On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little box. It
       was of no remarkable character, and I had seen it frequently before, for
       it was the property of the family physician; but how came it _there_,
       upon my table, and why did I shudder in regarding it? These things were
       in no manner to be accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the
       open pages of a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The words
       were the singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat:--“_Dicebant
       mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum
       fore levatas_.” Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head
       erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed
       within my veins?

       There came a light tap at the library door--and, pale as the tenant of a
       tomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were wild with terror,
       and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and very low. What said
       he?--some broken sentences I heard. He told of a wild cry disturbing the
       silence of the night--of the gathering together of the household--of
       a search in the direction of the sound; and then his tones grew
       thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave--of
       a disfigured body enshrouded, yet still breathing--still
       palpitating--_still alive_!

       He pointed to garments;--they were muddy and clotted with gore. I spoke
       not, and he took me gently by the hand: it was indented with the impress
       of human nails. He directed my attention to some object against the
       wall. I looked at it for some minutes: it was a spade. With a shriek I
       bounded to the table, and grasped the box that lay upon it. But I could
       not force it open; and in my tremor, it slipped from my hands, and fell
       heavily, and burst into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound,
       there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled with
       thirty-two small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered
       to and fro about the floor.




       ELEONORA

            Sub conservatione formae specificae salva anima.

                               _  Raymond Lully_.

       I AM come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion. Men
       have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether
       madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence--whether much that is
       glorious--whether all that is profound--does not spring from disease
       of thought--from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general
       intellect. They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which
       escape those who dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain
       glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that they
       have been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn
       something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledge
       which is of evil. They penetrate, however, rudderless or compassless
       into the vast ocean of the “light ineffable,” and again, like the
       adventures of the Nubian geographer, “agressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quid
       in eo esset exploraturi.”

       We will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there are two
       distinct conditions of my mental existence--the condition of a lucid
       reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of events
       forming the first epoch of my life--and a condition of shadow and doubt,
       appertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutes
       the second great era of my being. Therefore, what I shall tell of the
       earlier period, believe; and to what I may relate of the later time,
       give only such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, if
       doubt it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.

       She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and distinctly
       these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only sister of my
       mother long departed. Eleonora was the name of my cousin. We had
       always dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun, in the Valley of the
       Many-Colored Grass. No unguided footstep ever came upon that vale; for
       it lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around
       about it, shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No path
       was trodden in its vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there was
       need of putting back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of
       forest trees, and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of
       fragrant flowers. Thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothing
       of the world without the valley--I, and my cousin, and her mother.

       From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our
       encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, brighter than
       all save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding stealthily about in mazy
       courses, it passed away, at length, through a shadowy gorge, among hills
       still dimmer than those whence it had issued. We called it the “River
       of Silence”; for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow.
       No murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the
       pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its bosom,
       stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each in its own old
       station, shining on gloriously forever.

       The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided
       through devious ways into its channel, as well as the spaces that
       extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until
       they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom,--these spots, not less
       than the whole surface of the valley, from the river to the mountains
       that girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick,
       short, perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled
       throughout with the yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple
       violet, and the ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to
       our hearts in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God.

       And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wildernesses of
       dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall slender stems stood not
       upright, but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon-day
       into the centre of the valley. Their mark was speckled with the vivid
       alternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save
       the cheeks of Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge
       leaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying
       with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of Syria
       doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.

       Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with
       Eleonora before Love entered within our hearts. It was one evening at
       the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my own,
       that we sat, locked in each other’s embrace, beneath the serpent-like
       trees, and looked down within the water of the River of Silence at our
       images therein. We spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day, and
       our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few. We had drawn the
       God Eros from that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us
       the fiery souls of our forefathers. The passions which had for centuries
       distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies for which they
       had been equally noted, and together breathed a delirious bliss over
       the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. A change fell upon all things.
       Strange, brilliant flowers, star-shaped, burn out upon the trees
       where no flowers had been known before. The tints of the green carpet
       deepened; and when, one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there
       sprang up in place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. And
       life arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with
       all gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us. The
       golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of which
       issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, into a
       lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of Aeolus-sweeter than
       all save the voice of Eleonora. And now, too, a voluminous cloud, which
       we had long watched in the regions of Hesper, floated out thence, all
       gorgeous in crimson and gold, and settling in peace above us, sank, day
       by day, lower and lower, until its edges rested upon the tops of the
       mountains, turning all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us
       up, as if forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.

       The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was a
       maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the
       flowers. No guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart,
       and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together
       in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the mighty
       changes which had lately taken place therein.

       At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad change
       which must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one
       sorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our converse, as, in the songs
       of the bard of Schiraz, the same images are found occurring, again and
       again, in every impressive variation of phrase.

       She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom--that, like the
       ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die; but
       the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she
       revealed to me, one evening at twilight, by the banks of the River of
       Silence. She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valley
       of the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses,
       transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some
       maiden of the outer and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw
       myself hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to
       herself and to Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any
       daughter of Earth--that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dear
       memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had
       blessed me. And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the
       pious solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I invoked of Him and
       of her, a saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise,
       involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit
       me to make record of it here. And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew
       brighter at my words; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been
       taken from her breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she
       made acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it made
       easy to her the bed of her death. And she said to me, not many days
       afterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of what I had done for
       the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when
       departed, and, if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the
       watches of the night; but, if this thing were, indeed, beyond the power
       of the souls in Paradise, that she would, at least, give me frequent
       indications of her presence, sighing upon me in the evening winds, or
       filling the air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of the
       angels. And, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent
       life, putting an end to the first epoch of my own.

       Thus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier in Time’s
       path, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with the second
       era of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over my brain, and I
       mistrust the perfect sanity of the record. But let me on.--Years dragged
       themselves along heavily, and still I dwelled within the Valley of the
       Many-Colored Grass; but a second change had come upon all things. The
       star-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared no
       more. The tints of the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red
       asphodels withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten
       by ten, dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever
       encumbered with dew. And Life departed from our paths; for the tall
       flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us, but flew
       sadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay glowing birds that
       had arrived in his company. And the golden and silver fish swam down
       through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet
       river never again. And the lulling melody that had been softer than
       the wind-harp of Aeolus, and more divine than all save the voice of
       Eleonora, it died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower and
       lower, until the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity
       of its original silence. And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose,
       and, abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell
       back into the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold golden
       and gorgeous glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.

       Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the sounds
       of the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holy
       perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, when
       my heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden
       with soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, and
       once--oh, but once only! I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber
       of death, by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.

       But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. I longed
       for the love which had before filled it to overflowing. At length the
       valley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and I left it for
       ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.

       I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have served
       to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed so long in the
       Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. The pomps and pageantries of a stately
       court, and the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness of women,
       bewildered and intoxicated my brain. But as yet my soul had proved true
       to its vows, and the indications of the presence of Eleonora were still
       given me in the silent hours of the night. Suddenly these manifestations
       they ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood
       aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible
       temptations which beset me; for there came from some far, far distant
       and unknown land, into the gay court of the king I served, a maiden to
       whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once--at whose footstool
       I bowed down without a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject
       worship of love. What, indeed, was my passion for the young girl of
       the valley in comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the
       spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my whole
       soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?--Oh, bright
       was the seraph Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had room for none
       other.--Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as I looked down into
       the depths of her memorial eyes, I thought only of them--and of her.

       I wedded;--nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness was
       not visited upon me. And once--but once again in the silence of the
       night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken
       me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying:

       “Sleep in peace!--for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, in
       taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved,
       for reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vows
       unto Eleonora.”




       NOTES TO THIS VOLUME

       Notes -- Scheherezade

       (*1) The coralites.

       (*2) “One of the most remarkable natural curiosities in Texas is a
       petrified forest, near the head of Pasigno river. It consists of several
       hundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to stone. Some trees,
       now growing, are partly petrified. This is a startling fact for natural
       philosophers, and must cause them to modify the existing theory of
       petrification.--_Kennedy_.

       This account, at first discredited, has since been corroborated by the
       discovery of a completely petrified forest, near the head waters of the
       Cheyenne, or Chienne river, which has its source in the Black Hills of
       the rocky chain.

       There is scarcely, perhaps, a spectacle on the surface of the globe more
       remarkable, either in a geological or picturesque point of view than
       that presented by the petrified forest, near Cairo. The traveller,
       having passed the tombs of the caliphs, just beyond the gates of the
       city, proceeds to the southward, nearly at right angles to the road
       across the desert to Suez, and after having travelled some ten miles up
       a low barren valley, covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh as
       if the tide had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of sandhills,
       which has for some distance run parallel to his path. The scene now
       presented to him is beyond conception singular and desolate. A mass of
       fragments of trees, all converted into stone, and when struck by his
       horse’s hoof ringing like cast iron, is seen to extend itself for miles
       and miles around him, in the form of a decayed and prostrate forest.
       The wood is of a dark brown hue, but retains its form in perfection, the
       pieces being from one to fifteen feet in length, and from half a foot to
       three feet in thickness, strewed so closely together, as far as the eye
       can reach, that an Egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its way through
       amongst them, and so natural that, were it in Scotland or Ireland, it
       might pass without remark for some enormous drained bog, on which the
       exhumed trees lay rotting in the sun. The roots and rudiments of the
       branches are, in many cases, nearly perfect, and in some the worm-holes
       eaten under the bark are readily recognizable. The most delicate of the
       sap vessels, and all the finer portions of the centre of the wood, are
       perfectly entire, and bear to be examined with the strongest magnifiers.
       The whole are so thoroughly silicified as to scratch glass and are
       capable of receiving the highest polish.-- _Asiatic Magazine_.

       (*5) “During the eruption of Hecla, in 1766, clouds of this kind
       produced such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is more than
       fifty leagues from the mountain, people could only find their way by
       groping. During the eruption of Vesuvius, in 1794, at Caserta, four
       leagues distant, people could only walk by the light of torches. On the
       first of May, 1812, a cloud of volcanic ashes and sand, coming from a
       volcano in the island of St. Vincent, covered the whole of Barbadoes,
       spreading over it so intense a darkness that, at mid-day, in the open
       air, one could not perceive the trees or other objects near him, or
       even a white handkerchief placed at the distance of six inches from the
       eye._”--Murray, p. 215, Phil. edit._

       (*6) In the year 1790, in the Caraccas during an earthquake a portion of
       the granite soil sank and left a lake eight hundred yards in diameter,
       and from eighty to a hundred feet deep. It was a part of the forest of
       Aripao which sank, and the trees remained green for several months under
       the water.”--_Murray_, p. 221

       blowpipe, be reduced to an impalpable powder, which will float readily
       in the atmospheric air.

       (*9) The Myrmeleon-lion-ant. The term “monster” is equally applicable
       to small abnormal things and to great, while such epithets as “vast” are
       merely comparative. The cavern of the myrmeleon is vast in comparison
       with the hole of the common red ant. A grain of silex is also a “rock.”

       (*10) The _Epidendron, Flos Aeris,_ of the family of the _Orchideae_,

       air.

       (*12) _Schouw_ advocates a class of plants that grow upon living
       animals--the _Plantae_ _Epizoae_. Of this class are the _Fuci_ and
       _Algae_.

       _Mr. J. B. Williams, of Salem, Mass._, presented the “National
       Institute” with an insect from New Zealand, with the following
       description: “‘_The Hotte_, a decided caterpillar, or worm, is found
       gnawing at the root of the _Rota_ tree, with a plant growing out of its
       head. This most peculiar and extraordinary insect travels up both the
       _Rota_ and _Ferriri_ trees, and entering into the top, eats its way,
       perforating the trunk of the trees until it reaches the root, and dies,
       or remains dormant, and the plant propagates out of its head; the body
       remains perfect and entire, of a harder substance than when alive. From
       this insect the natives make a coloring for tattooing.

       _fungus_ that emits an intense phosphorescence.

       (*15) The corolla of this flower (_Aristolochia Clematitis_), which is
       tubular, but terminating upwards in a ligulate limb, is inflated into a
       globular figure at the base. The tubular part is internally beset with
       stiff hairs, pointing downwards. The globular part contains the
       pistil, which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together with the
       surrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter than the germen,
       cannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as the
       flower stands always upright till after impregnation. And hence, without
       some additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily fan down
       to the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature has furnished in
       this case, is that of the _Tiputa Pennicornis_, a small insect, which
       entering the tube of the corrolla in quest of honey, descends to the
       bottom, and rummages about till it becomes quite covered with pollen;
       but not being able to force its way out again, owing to the downward
       position of the hairs, which converge to a point like the wires of a
       mouse-trap, and being somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes
       backwards and forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly
       traversing the stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its
       impregnation, in consequence of which the flower soon begins to droop,
       and the hairs to shrink to the sides of the tube, effecting an easy
       passage for the escape of the insect.”--_Rev. P. Keith-System of
       Physiological Botany_.

       (*16) The bees--ever since bees were--have been constructing their
       cells with just such sides, in just such number, and at just such
       inclinations, as it has been demonstrated (in a problem involving the
       profoundest mathematical principles) are the very sides, in the very
       number, and at the very angles, which will afford the creatures the most
       room that is compatible with the greatest stability of structure.

       During the latter part of the last century, the question arose among
       mathematicians--“to determine the best form that can be given to the
       sails of a windmill, according to their varying distances from the
       revolving vanes, and likewise from the centres of the revoloution.” This
       is an excessively complex problem, for it is, in other words, to find
       the best possible position at an infinity of varied distances and at an
       infinity of points on the arm. There were a thousand futile attempts to
       answer the query on the part of the most illustrious mathematicians, and
       when at length, an undeniable solution was discovered, men found that
       the wings of a bird had given it with absolute precision ever since the
       first bird had traversed the air.

       (*17) He observed a flock of pigeons passing betwixt Frankfort and the
       Indian territory, one mile at least in breadth; it took up four hours
       in passing, which, at the rate of one mile per minute, gives a length
       of 240 miles; and, supposing three pigeons to each square yard, gives
       2,230,272,000 Pigeons.--“_Travels in Canada and the United States,” by

       of 71 miles per hour has been attained. A train weighing 90 tons was
       whirled from Paddington to Didcot (53 miles) in 51 minutes.

       (*31) Common experiments in Natural Philosophy. If two red rays from two
       luminous points be admitted into a dark chamber so as to fall on a
       white surface, and differ in their length by 0.0000258 of an inch,
       their intensity is doubled. So also if the difference in length be any
       whole-number multiple of that fraction. A multiple by 2 1/4, 3 1/4, &c.,
       gives an intensity equal to one ray only; but a multiple by 2 1/2, 3
       1/2, &c., gives the result of total darkness. In violet rays similar
       effects arise when the difference in length is 0.000157 of an inch; and
       with all other rays the results are the same--the difference varying
       with a uniform increase from the violet to the red.

       “Analogous experiments in respect to sound produce analogous results.”

       (*32) Place a platina crucible over a spirit lamp, and keep it a red
       heat; pour in some sulphuric acid, which, though the most volatile of
       bodies at a common temperature, will be found to become completely fixed
       in a hot crucible, and not a drop evaporates--being surrounded by an
       atmosphere of its own, it does not, in fact, touch the sides. A few
       drops of water are now introduced, when the acid, immediately coming in
       contact with the heated sides of the crucible, flies off in sulphurous
       acid vapor, and so rapid is its progress, that the caloric of the water
       passes off with it, which falls a lump of ice to the bottom; by taking
       advantage of the moment before it is allowed to remelt, it may be turned
       out a lump of ice from a red-hot vessel.

       (*33) The Daguerreotype.

       (*34) Although light travels 167,000 miles in a second, the distance
       of 61 Cygni (the only star whose distance is ascertained) is so
       inconceivably great, that its rays would require more than ten years to
       reach the earth. For stars beyond this, 20--or even 1000 years--would
       be a moderate estimate. Thus, if they had been annihilated 20, or 1000
       years ago, we might still see them to-day by the light which started
       from their surfaces 20 or 1000 years in the past time. That many which
       we see daily are really extinct, is not impossible--not even improbable.
